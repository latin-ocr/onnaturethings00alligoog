nm ΟΝ THE NATURE OF THINGS

mdxisting without any foer of ohange.
But' smoe though breaksble they thus romain,
'lis not m reason thet thoy oould endure
'I'hroughout eternity the object still
Of blows unnumbered. And yet oneo again
Sinos there hes been assigned e timeto grew, >
A time in whioh to live, whet they oen do
By Notme's lews, what not, sinos all's arranged,
Nor suffers any ohenge, not ev'n the bitds
Oen change the merke which show their various·
It follows there must be to eeoh end ell
A body thot oen show no trsoe of ohonge.

. For if the elements of things oould alter
And be in turn o'eroome, 'twould be in doubt
What might or might not be the issue still,
What is the power assigned to eeoh, and what
The deep-set boundery none oon pass, nor oould
The tribes esoh in their order show their kind,
The habits, motione, feshions of their s1res.

An extreme point, thot furthest point itself

Is without perte, is of the smollest sizo,

Does not exist alone, nor ever hes,

Nor ever will, but still combined together
One efter other in a serried mass,

They go to form the primel body; thero
They oling together, end eennot be torn
