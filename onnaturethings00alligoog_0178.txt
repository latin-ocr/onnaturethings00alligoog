w Μ ΟΝ Tffls NATURE OF THINGS ,

Hidden benenth the earth, though in ιιο sky.
Again when our good horse in middle stream
Hss eineis, end we look down upon ιιο weves
Whirling along, their fores eit seems ιο ιο
Beering the stending horse eihwarb hbe stream,
Foreing ἱι upwerds, end where'er we look
All things seem ιο be eenied on end flow

{ff stannig wi un pillars ιο ne ene,
Yeb when it’s seen from ιιο top in eli ihs length,
f 'Pis like a nerrowing eone, joins roof with floor,
And right with left, until ἰι seems ιο be
The eone's point vanishes end fades irem sight.
ro seilors on the see bhe sun still seems “
Το rise from out¹ the weves, end in ibe weves
Το sink end hide his light: end just beeeuse
They nothing see ιιι see end sky: but you
Muet not believe our senses ebill ere wrong.
Το thoos who do ιιοι know the see, the ships
In herbour seem quine erippled, end ιο heve
Their siem nil broken, pressing up against
The weber round. For where ιιο ears ere raised .
'Above the salt were, they ere straight, end so
The rudder ιοο is straight, but ,where bhey’re' sunk
Benenth the weber, they appear ιο ιο
, Beni beelr end broken, sloping up end turned
Towerds the surieee, eo they almost seem
To fleat upon it. So it is when winde
Oerry light clouds seross the sky ab night,
“ The glibiering eonsbelletions seem ιο glide
Athwerb the reek, end brevel on above
In quine a different wey ιο which they go.
Or ir our hand be pleeed beneeth one eye
