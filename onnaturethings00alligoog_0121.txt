Τ. LUGRE‘PIUS CARUS

'fflffl in vain’s the lubom- οἳ his handu

And when he puts the present by the past,

His father’s fato ho blaesos, oft repente

How those of old, with pioty ruffinam

Livod easily upon some little plot, ’

As each man's share was smaller than wday.

So he who planta the old and shriveuod vine
Full sad lamenta tho movement of tho timos,
And wearies heaven with sighs‚ nor understands
That all things fade away by slow degroes

And meh tho gravo worn out by length of yom
