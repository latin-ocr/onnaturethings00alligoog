Beneclh ile cenet rell on their repid wevee

Demenchlia strumene everywhere 'e eike

The earth, all eheken by the ruin mede
Where nge has undermined the veety caves,
Tremblee above: whole moucheim iumble down,
And with the shoek the tremblinge spread efer:
And well they may, when buildings nem· e med

Of no great weighl: nor do they roek hhe lese-
When on ihc rond a sione etrikee up against
The wheele wilh iren rime en either eide
It happens, too, when ingruet yewning lnkee
A mese of soil dieplcced by ege ie rolled,
The earth cll ehivering roche with the great weveet
Juel ee e vene cannot remein ei rest
Until the water in ii ceeee io ewey.

Agein when wind collected through ihc eevee*
Of hollow earth ie blowing from one eide,
And preeeee with greci strength lhe caverna vent,
'lhe earth leene over ae the wind inclines.
Then every dwelling built above the ground„
,And all ihe mone the neerei· to the sky

In the seme wey, end beeme dislodged hang o'er

Reedy lo fell. And yet men shrink to believe

By lhe lmprleonmeni ol umny wind
Wlihln her womb, which lor enlngemenl eirlving
Shekee the old bellium earth and iepples down
