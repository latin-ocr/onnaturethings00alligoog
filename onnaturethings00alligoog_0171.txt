Theoi bodies whioh can etrike our eye end wake
Oux oenoe oi vision trovel wondrous iosh

Soonge, hoo, for ever etreem from oertoin things:
Just oe oold does imm rivere, heet from eun,
Sprey from the ocean eeting up the wells
Around our coneto. And veiious voices fly
Throughout tho eir. Α saltieh flavour comeo

th in our mouth, whene'er we welk beside

The seo, ond when we wohoh the wormwood mixed
A eenee of bitterness. In euch e oonetont stream
From oll these things oro borne their quelihiee,
And everywhere trenmitted, no deley,

No respite given, einoe we evei feel,

See ond smell oll things, eye, end hear their eound.

Tgffipffg Agoin‚ some flgme handled in the dark
eumne Ie known to be the seme eo that we saw

menuae. In the clear light of day: it noeds must be
MN Thoe houoh ond vision from one oense prooeed.

We handle something uere when it ie derk,
Audin the hgff νῇ ἕηκε oon ejrjheour sense,
But the ifflii?‚ So we eee, in iroth

The somne of eoem le in imagee,

Nor withou em eon onyt 'ng be viewed.

These filine Ι speok oi then ore borne about,

Disohoffliibuted on every'hiffe‘?

But sinoe our eyes mehey oome

Whiohever wey we turn, there eil the things

still meet ond etrike our eight with form end hue
