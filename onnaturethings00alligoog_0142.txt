ω mm ΟΝ THE NATURE OF THINGS

To laeve the body, because then no more

They’re held together. Surely air would be

Ibself a living thing, if but the eoul

Oould there exiet, and earry on the 'work

Ib did within the body. So again

And yet again, when oneo ia broken up

The ahelter of bhe body, and the air,

The vital air ’s foreed out, you must confess

'l'he sennes of the mind and soul as well

Muet be dissolved, their oense of death the same.
And einoe the body oan’b survive the loss

“dmg Why doubt the power of aoul, risen from within
From utmoat deptha, has thence escaped like
emoke,
And that the body then hae humblad in,
with sueh a foul oobapee, beoeuee ibe seat,
sta firm foundation hae been quite upset,
The seul eeeaping out through all the frama
Through every winding path that n ean find
And every opening that presente insen?
'l'hus you may know the eoul has ieeued out,
Nay, vves divided in the body first
Before, east out of doore, it reached the air.
&2 Even before the end of life is reeehod,
Shad· The sou] when suffering from some sudden shook,
osberne, Would eoem to wish to go and leave behind
aar, sd The body, and the features aeem ee dead,

dm aa„ And the Ξῐαοὶ limbe ebrink from tho bloodleea
ss¹ §vul nm ’

Ev’n so it is when as they say sometimes,

The mind ia done, or else the soul has gone:
Μ· Where 'all is haene, and every one desirea

Το stop the snapping of tha life's laet ehain.
