A sort 01 dinziness‚ but when they fall
To the very plece from which the poison springs,
Thon life itself they vomit forth, because
All round greci shore 01 poison still remeius.
Somelimes this exhalation springing up

with force from oui Avernus cen dispel
The eir, which lies between che birds end earth,
So 11101 e void almost is left: end when
The birds have reached the spol, the buoyeni force
within lheir wings is crippled‚ all cho power
Their pinions heve deperis cn either side.
And when they cen no longer bucy themselves
And leen upon their wings‚ 1ο earth ol once
They fell by neturel might, end lying deod,
In what is now e void, shed forth their soul
Through ell their body's poree, end end their life.

Dreined of its heah, the colder does become
The moislure 11 contains. Agein, when eerih
Grows ell compressed by frosl, contracte, congeels,

Wheiever heah 11 hes inho the wells.

And lhinlr 11 boile by 1110 influence ο1 lhe sun
Below the earth, when night hes hid us here
