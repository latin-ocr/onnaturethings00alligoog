Ae is seen when one aroueed from eleep eolleete
His thoughts together. Death must be muoh lese
For ue, if itha leeethan what we see
Ie naught. For greater surely le the lose
And the disorder of our earthly frames
That follows death, and no one wakee again
Who oneo hae felt ite ehilly hand on him.
,ἓξὲξ Or if again nature could find e voice,
lmffl'g And then reproaeh ue ln eueh werde ae these:
Ml· ‘What haet thou, man, eo mueh at beart, or why
Gtriev’st thou eo greatly? Why bewail thy death?
'Phe life that’s paeeed hae been a happy one,
Not all the bleeeinge that thou hedet ere loet
In a leaky veae, and gone without aveil=
Why not a satieted guest* depart,
' And gladly seiae, thou fool, the rest that oomeel
But if what you enjoyed hae waeted been,
All thrown away, aud life iteelf dieguete,
Whyseektoaddtoit,toloeeagain
And perieh all iu vein? Why not prefer
Το make an end of life and labour too?
For nought thore is that further I oen unul ‘
Or faehlon to give joy: all’e still the eume
“ 'l'hough years have not deeayed thy body, nor
Languieh thy limbe with time, all’e still thesemo,
Ev’n though you should outlaet all living things,
Muoh more if you should never die et all:
What anewor ean we make eave to admit
