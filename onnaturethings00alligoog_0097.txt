Which liquid are, oi fluid form must still
Consist oi things more smooth and round, for so
The several drops are not so close combined,
And in their onward oourse flow easily down.
And all things whioh you see at onos disperse
As smoke and mist aud flame, if they do not
Consist of bodies small and round, must still
Not be held fast by intertwining seeds3

That they may pieros the body, find a way
With biting force, and yet not oling together.
Thus you may know what of this sort we see,
Whioh when presented to the sensas thus

Are formed of pointed, not of tangled seeds.
Yet do not hold it strange thet fluid things,
Like tha sea spray, are bittsrz in es far

As thoy are fluid they're oomposed oi seeds

Both smooth and round, and yet some rough ones -
are

Mixed up with these, producing pain, not hookod

Enough to hang together, but though rough

They’re round, and while they swiftly roll ean hurt

'l'he sense. That you more easily believe

'l'he bitterness oi Neptune’s water eomes

From these rough bodies, there are means employed

To separate the parts, as you see when

Frssh water’s often fllterad through the earth,

It flows into a trenoh, and grows quite sweet;

lt leaves the bitter elements behind,

Whioh, being rough‚ more easily ean stay.

The germs have varied shepes, but still they are
In number linita If it were not so
