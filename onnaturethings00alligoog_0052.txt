mm ΟΝ THE Nireus OF sumes

With sudden stream, augmented from the hille

By heevy reins, it rushes from above

Hurling the foreet’s wreok end mighty trees:

Nor oen the strong-built bridges ev'n endure

Its sudden osset, driven by the floods

The river rushes on the piiss with ell

Its strength, spreeds ruin with a rosr, ·

Displeees mighty stenes, ond sweeps ewey

Whetever may impede its onwsrd rush.

Just so then must the blests of wind advenee,

And when like some strong streem they heve been
borne

ln one directim, they sweep sll ewey

And ruin eil eround with frequent storme,

Or sometimes eeteh things up with eddying whirls

And beer them off with swirling hurrioenee.

Wherefore onoe more there ere, be sure, these

Whose forms you eennot see, whieh emulete

In deeds end weys the mighty river’e fores,

All visible enough. 'l'here are egeln

The soents of various objecta, whose approach

Your eight eennot deteet; nor do we see

The hest of summer, nor the winter’s eold:

Nor voiees which we beer esu we desory:

And yet these things must heve e body, einos

'l'hey all effect our senses, end unless

'l'hey hed sueh body they oould not be touched

Or touoh us in return. Another ease,

Olothes hung upon the wave-beat shore grow dsmp

And in the sun they dsy, end yet the while

You oennot see the dempness soeking in,

Nor how it flies before the heet again·

'I'he dempness then in little pertielee
