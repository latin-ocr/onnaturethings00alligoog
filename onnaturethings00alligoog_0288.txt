There ere whioh een relax the sainting limbs

And make the seul to weeken in its seat.

Thus if you linger long, when somewhnt full,

In the hot bathe, how apt you ere to fell .

When sitting ’mid the boiling water there

within your hub. How easily the fumes

And dengenous foroe of chareoel reseh the brein,

If we heve not drunk water first. But when

with greater force it hes filled thomum within

The poison's odour gives a murderous blew3⁴

And see you not, how sulphur is contained

In the earth itself, and piboh assumes tho form

of lumps with noxious smell? And so again

In seeking seins of silver end of gold,

And seerohing with a piok the hidden *parte

From down below? what danger springs again

From mines of gold? whae feoes on the men.

And what complexione? See ond hear you not

How short the time they live, how life soon faiis

Who bear such toil of grim necessity?

Such exhalatione then tho earth steems forth,

And spreeds abroed into the light of day. ,
