ΟΝ THE NATURE OF THINGS
gymno saliva, wasbee and kille ibeelf

By gnavving οι ite body. Hellebore

Το us ie poison, but ιο goaba and quails

Ia fatbening. Thai you may know the feet

Remember what we said before, that seoda

Oi things are mixed in many different ways.

Again all living oreabares taking foed,

Just aa they’re different in exterior

And eaob a differenb eonbour hee of limbo,

Coneieb of aeede of varying figure ιοο.

And aa the eeeda bhue differ, there mueb be

A differenoe in the intervals and ways

Which we barm opening'a in the limbo and mouth

And palato ιοο. Some you will find are small,

Some large, some will three-eernered be, some
flium,

Many are round, and many various shepea

¹ . with every kind of angle. As the ebepee ,

01 eeeda and aa their motione may require,
There munt be various openings, varying ιοο,
According ιο bhe texture of tho seed

And eo when what ie eweet ιο this, ιο theb
Ia bitben surely that which ia thus eweeb

Muat of the emoobheeb seoda be formed, whieh

Enter the palabe’a poree with gentleeb touch:
While he ιο whom the thing ie bitber, must
Find rough·hooked partiales within his bhroab3
All eeeee ιοο from thie you'll understand,
When fever eomes from overmaabering bile
Or any other eauae ereabee disease,

The body suffere aa a whole, and all

The partiales within are rearranged:

The things that euibed ιο our baete before
