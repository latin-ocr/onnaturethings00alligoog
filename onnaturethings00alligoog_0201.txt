Τ. LUGRETIUS OARUS

ft iiidimiie quenehed. Yet Nature shows thet all

Is just the other wey; in this one thing

The more we heve of it, the more our heert
Burns with e fleroe desire. For foed end drink
We take within us, end es oertein parts

They easily fill, the oreving thet we heve

For them is setisfled3 but from the humen ieee
And lovely bloom, nothing eveils to pass

Το be enjoyed but images so light

That lovesiek hope soon soetters to the wind.
Just as in sleep e thirsty men will seek

Το drink, and nought is given to assuage

The flre thet burns within, he seeks to feign
An image oi astream, but nll in vein, ¹
And drinking in the flood is thirstyetil13

Ev’n so does Venus moek the loving mind
With images, mere gezing on the form

Gen never setisfy, nor is there eught he oen
'Peer off the tender limbs with eager hands
'Phet wonder in uncertainty about.

At length when seted is the strong desire
That’s gethered up, there eomes e little pause
In furious possiem bnt there eomes egain
The seliseme mednees thet there was before, ·
'Phe frenzy wild when they desire to ettein

'I'o what they wieh and cannot, nor devise
Whet art may eure their ill: unoertein thus
They pine away with wounds thet none een see.

ee , Remember too their strength still westes away,

Their lebour naught eveils: their life is lived
At another’e book end eall: their money goes

Wasted on Babylonien eoverlets;
'I'heir duties ere neglected, their good neme
