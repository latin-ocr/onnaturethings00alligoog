ss mm Τ. LUORETIUS OARUS

No body een heve feeling till it's born:
Because the germs lie seattered everywhere,
In air end rivers, earth end things of earth,
And till they meet end eoeleste, there are
No vital motione to eall into play
In every living thing omniseient sense.

Bloweput Agein a blow too strong for its nature eomes

midi On any living creature suddenly,
Destroys its life, end etune its every sense
of mind end body: all the seeds dissolved
And vitel motione stopped, until et length
'l'he matter widely seettered through the whole
Unties the vitel festenings of the seul,
Disperses it ebroed end drives it out
Through every pore. For what do we suppose
A blow oen do, than shelre end disunite
The verinus elementer Yet sometimes too
When the blow is less severe, whet'e left of lile
May oft prevess, preveil, Ι say, and still
'l'he tumult thet’s oeeesionedby the blow,
Recoll eeeh funetion to its proper plere,
Sheke off deoth's hand now ruling in the frome,
And light again the sense thet almost failed.
How else oould it regethering strength ol mind
Return to life, doeth’s threshold nearly erossed,
Rether then poss beyond, and diseppeer?

,fflfflfl Besides, sinoe there is puin when metter’s germs,

mmmm· Sheken by blows through living flesh end frume,
Queke in their seete within, end then egeln,
When they return, e quiet joy eneues‚
From this you gether thet the seeds themselves
Nor pain nor pleesure know: sinee thet they ere
Not formed of elements thet ehenge effeots
Either with sorrow, or with gentle joy:
