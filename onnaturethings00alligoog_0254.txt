ΟΝ THE NATURE OF THINGS

{hlfflunds of war to suffer ¹ond tho ronkn

Of Mars disordor. So sod discord formod

Ono thing upon another, bo offright
,ς’ Tho world in arms, ond every day that possed
Ψ But added to the horrore of stom war.

Ἢ Bulla, ooo, woro tried in flght, ond sovogo bom
Lat loooo against the foe. Some sont before
Strong lions with ormbd trainors, ond o host
Of oavogo koopors‚ who oould guido their oourso
And hold them fast in chaino: in vain, since thoy
Amid tho moloe warming⁹ in their rago
Modo no distinctions, shoking high their head·
With terror-striking oreste on every nido:

Nor oould tho horsomon sootho their fn'ghtonod
otoods.

And turn thom ’goinst tho foe. Thon with a spring

'l'ho lionossoo thmw their ongry limbo

In all diroobions, sometimes sought tho faoo ·

Of their opponente, sometimes bore ohe book

of the unwory foe, ond twining round

Would dash to earth the woundod‚ olinging on

with mage bite and hookod olaws. Tho bulla

wouldyoss their friends, ond teor them with
Gorghleizlfeffioir horno tho bellios ond thesides
of the hortos underneath, tho earth aptum

With thrgatoning front. Tho boon-s, too, would
ron

'I'hoso on their sido with savogo tueha, aod dyo
with their own blood the woopons broko in thom,
'rho very woopons broken in their uideo,

And put to flight tho horso ond foot oliko.

'rho horsea turning sidowoys tried to osoope

'l'ho puoh of oruol tusk. or rooring up
