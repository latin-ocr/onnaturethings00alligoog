Will not permit our naming it, although

lts meaning ean be easily explained.

For first he thinks, for instance, bones are formed

Of very small and minute bones, so flesh

of very small and minute bits, and blood

By the union of many drops of ir.

And so he thinks that gold of golden grains

Is iramed, and earth of little bits oi earth

Can grow, moisture from moisture, flre from lire,

And so in the same way of all things else:

And yet he allows no void, no bounds are sot

To things dividing. Thus he seems to me

'ro err as much as those I named before.

Besides, too frail his primal germs must be

If they be only suoh as are possessed

Of a nature like the things themselves, and have

N o more immunity from toil and death,

Nothing to stay destruction. Which oi them

Will stand against strong fores, and death escape

When in the very jaws of fate? Will flre,

Or air, or water, aye or blood, or bones?

Not one, methinks, sinae eaeh and all will be

As mortal utterly as those we see

Perish before our eyes o'eroome by forae.

I eall to witness, what I've shown before,

Things cannot shrink to naught, or from it grow.

Besides, since food maintains and nonrishe's

Our frama, you know our veins, and blood, and
bones,

And nervos, are formed of things unlike them-
salves:

' Or if they say all foods aro mixed in kind,

And have within them partiales oi sinews,
And bones, and veins, and drops of blood as well,
