For eure whatever doth ite bounds o'erpeee,

And so the mind by being einh inoff,
Or neediug treatment givos e oertein eigu
Of ite momlity. And thus we see
To reasoning ielee, truth etill presente iteelf,
Will not allow the eeeeilent to eeoepe,
But with o two-edged argument nohieves

And maes ite parte together, end draw sense

In the treme of those, who dying bit by bit
Thue leave the light, yet you must still admit
The soul ie mortui, nor doth it matter muoh
