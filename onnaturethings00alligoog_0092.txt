ΟΝ THE NATURE ΟΡ THINGS

mm Nor was tho mm

”mm Of matter 0'er more closely paekod‚ nor yet
More Ιοοεο with larger intervals of spano:
It cannot grow or dwindle. So the sends
To-day have tho same motion, that thoy had
In days gono by, and will have to the end:
what was bogot will be bogotten still
On tho same law: will bo, will grow and wax
As long as Nature's lawe permit to each.
No foroe ean change the universe: for naught
Thero is beyond to which escape can bo,
Nor whence new forno can now bo introduood
And rush upon the soene, and change the lawe
of Nature, and its motione so oonfoumL
mmmm Nor need you wonder while tho seoda are all
