In safety rears the tender plante to light?

But if they come from nothing, then be sure ¹
'l'hey would, or here, or there spring suddenly.
One knowe not where, at unpropitious times,
Sinos there would be no primal elementa

Which might at unfit season be held book

From generating eontaot. N or if ,things

Oould eome from nothing, would there need to be
An interval of time for their increase.

ο The puny bebe would straight become a youth,
And trees full-blown leap sudden from the earth. '
But none of these things eomes to pase, because
All grow by slow degrees from certain seeds,

As fitting is, and each preserves its kind,

So you ean tell how eeeh grows great and strong
From its own substanee. Add this further laet

Nor without foed could living things avail

So thet the rather you might well suppose
