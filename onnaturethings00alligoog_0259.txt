ffiffiads, and dress, and many things beside,

And all che prizes, all the sweefis of life,

From top to bottom‚ songs and pietures too,
And wondrous statues oarvod, all these did use
And the experienoe of the notive mind

Teaoh men by slow degroes, and stop by step,

As they advanoed. So years bring everything
Before men’s mindsz then reason raison them

Into tho light of day. For things must grow
One on another elearer and more brighb
In arte, until they've reaqhed their topmost height.
