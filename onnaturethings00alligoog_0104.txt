ΟΝ 'rme NATURE OF mnes
tlF'ffldiwliods must ever oi necessity

llnjoy immortal life, complete reposo

Far, iar away, withdrawn from our oonoerns,

Unwitting pain, from aare and danger free,

Strong in themselves, nor wanting ought of us:

Our favonrs touoh them not, nor our ill deeds

Arouse their anger. Here if any think

ro eall the sea by Neptune’s title, oorn

From Ceres, Bacchus’ name misuse instead

of that which properly belongs to wine:

Well be it so, and let him further say

The Barth is mother of the Gods, ii but

He free his sonl from superstition’s ties

isgraoeiul to be borne. Earth feels it not,

She has no sense of what these things may be,

And having in herself the seeds oi things

She brings them to the light in many ways.

munes And so the woolly flooks, the martial eteeds‚

stiffi The horned herds, benfflth heaven's oanopy
{Q Cropping the grass within the selfsame field,

Slsking their thirst from the same flowing stream,

Are different in type, and still retain

Their parents’ character, and imitate

'Phe ways of each. So great the differenoe is .

In every kind of herb, in streame as well.

And so whatever animal you take,

Bonos, blood and veina, and heat and molatura,

flesh
And sinews form the whole, yet all nnlike,
And made from seeds dissimilar in shepe.

honour ot being so used ln that pleae.
