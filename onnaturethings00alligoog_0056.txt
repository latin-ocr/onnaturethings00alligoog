Lm ΟΝ THE} NATURE' OF THINGS

ᾟΜ, Wherefore‚ however much you mey delsy‚
fflffihlleging various reasons, in the end
*M Yon must admit there is e void. And Ι
Oould still sey many things to prove my words.
But for a sapient mind, these footprints which “
Ι indicate ore in themselves enough
⁸ Το show the rest For es the hounds full oft
By scent find out the lenfy leir of some
Wild mountain-reaming beast, when once they've
hit
Suro traces of his peth, so you yomself
One thing upon another now cen see
In themes like there, end melre your wey alone
Through cll the hidden coverts thet there ere,
And drew the 'llruth from thence. And if you tire
Or slscken somewhet in the chere, yet still
This, Memmius, can Ι promise you oli-hond,
Thet such large bounteous drsugh'ts from mighty
sprmgs
My tongue will pour from my own heert so full,
Thet much Ι feer old ege will on us creep,
And loose the stringe of life, before your ears
Have heard ev'n on one subject ell my song.
ΑΒ thium Now to resume the thread of my design.
siliis& All nature, esitio, is formed end iremed
Q Of these two things, of bodies end e void,
In which they dwell, end move them to end fro. g
For thet there is e body feeling proves,
Feeling thet ell possess: unless in this
Your foith is iiusd end sure, there will be neught
Το which we oen refer in hidden things
To prove our points by ressoning of the mind.

And next unless there be both room and space
Which we term void, nowhere could bodies be,
