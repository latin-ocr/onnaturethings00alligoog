To think thet they could ever ieci the same,
Is ioolish: what could be more differant,
More inharmonious and more estranged, .
Thon mortni with immortai, thus to try
In constant nnion stili to bravo the storm,
The bitter storm oi life? But ii the soui
Is to be held immortal, as that it
Is shelteied from the things that make ior death,
Either because what is injurious

Retires again before we suffer loss,

Oi things to come, which makes it siok with iear,
Wearied with care, besides the sad remorae

Alone, the loss oi memory, and again
It sometimes sinks in lethargy’s derk streame-‘uf
