From every part where was the plegue: they filled
All pleees, every building: eo the more

Many indueed by thirst, upon the street,
Their bodies iuet ehrown down, would lie beside
The welle of veter, end eo leet their livee
By their too great indulgence in the stream:
And many in the pleee where people meet,
And in the streete you'd eee their limbo drooped

Half daed end foul with eteneh‚ with rege

Dying of fllth, just ekin end bone, who were
Buried already in foul soree end dire
And ell the holy templee of the (rode
