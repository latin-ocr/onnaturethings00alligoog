mam ΟΝ THE NATURE OF THINGS

Why are all qualities inborn in ue- x
Our limbs and temper-from our earliest days,

If not beoause a certain power oi mind
Derired irem seed and breed grows step by step
With the body’s growth? If mind humortel were,
Ii it oouid change the bodies where it dwslls‚
Thon animale would change their character:
Tho'hound Hyrcania* brad would fly the stag,
'Phe hawk in air would oower before tho dove.
Men’s 'minds would fail, and wild beasts minda
possess.

'l'o say as some bave done the soul ean ohange
With ehange of place, beoome another soni,
Is false: for what is changed, is so dissolved,
It dies; the parte are shiited from their ploee,
And lose their order: they must be dispersed
Throughout the frome, in order that at leet
They ono and all may with the body die.
But ii they say that still the souls oi men
Muet go to humen bodies, then I ask
How is it that a soul thet’s wiso, becomes
Foolish sometimes, how is it that a boy
Wants prudenoe, why a foai, though trained, is not
The equod of the horse in strength? Be sure
Tbey'll try to eseape by saying thet the sonl
In a week body's weale And if they do
'l'hey must admit the soui is mortal, sinoe
By being so changed it loses liis and sense.
How ean it with the body grow in strength
And reaeh tho much-desired flower oi age,
