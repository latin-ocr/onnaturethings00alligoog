ΟΝ THE NATURE Oh* THINGS

1111111311 with raving dogs, end other things

01 the 001110 sort, whose limbs we seo 0011 110’01

Agree together: 101 they do not 100011

Their prime together, 1101 0110111 their strength,

Nor 1000 11 when 011110 01110110οἁ 10 ege.

Nor do they 1010, 1101 ere in 0110100101

’1110 seme, nor do the 001110 things ploese their
001100.

Τ11110 you moy often see the boarded goets

011 11011110011 1011011, poisonous to men.

And then 011100 fleme 10 wont to 0001011 01111 burn

Tho towny frames othone, just 00 muoh

As 111000 01110011 01111 blood upon the 001111,

How could it 110111111001111110101 1100,

Triple yet 0110, 0 11011 111 1110110111,

Drogon behind, 01111 111 the middle goat,

Broething fleroe 1101110 110111 inwerds through 110
mouth?

So 110 who fancies when the 001111 was now,

And heaven just mede, suoh living creaturos were,

Resting his oose on this one word 01 ‘new,'

May bebble mnoh 01 such-like things, 01111 1011

How rivers 1011 111 1100110 01 gold on earth,

And trees did blossom gome, 0111111011 was born
With suoh 0 strength 01 1101110 thet 110 oould
On 1001 001000 wide 0000, and whirl tho 11001οι10
Around him with his 11011110. For sure the 1001
Τ1101 there were many 000110 011 earth what time
The world bore 0111111010, 10 yet no prooi

That beasts 0110110110 kinds were mixed together
And members joined in 0110, 10001100 ov'n now
