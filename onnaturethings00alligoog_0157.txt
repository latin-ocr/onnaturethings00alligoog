And now thou diest: but bereum you long
For that which is not here, despise whet’e youre,

And rightly rolliee surh a men ee this,
For ege must still give plone to newer things,
And one replooe another: none is hurled
Down to the darkeome pit of Tartarus:
Metter ie needed, thet afuturo ege
May grew ond flourieh: when theyve done with

They'll follow thee: no lese then you they've died
In days gone by, end eo will do again
So one upon another still will oome,
Life’e given in foe to none, to ell to use.
