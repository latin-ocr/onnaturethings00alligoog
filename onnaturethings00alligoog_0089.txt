’ΜΘ Ἥ And this, too, underehend: when bodico thus
mm: Are borne {beer down through void by their own

At timeo ond points of space unflxed, they swerve*
A little from their line, just eo much ee
Thac you cen mark the change. Ii 'twere noh eo
They ell would foll jueh like the drope oi rein
straight through the void: there would heve been
no cloch, ’
No blow inflicbed on the eeede, end eo
Hed Nelure ne’er bcgctien ought et ell.

And blows inflict, which motion cen hegeh, ·
He wondere from the iroth. For when seede fell
Through water end thin eir, they take their epeed
According ho their weighi, because 'tis clear
'l'he volume cf the water end hhin eir
Resiei noi everybhing wilh equol strength,
But yield more quickly to the grqeher weighte:
void, on bhe other hand, cau ne'er reeieh
Ac eny bime or place, but must give wey
Ae Nature aske: end ell things must periorce
Be moved ond borne elong ei equel poce,
Although of different weighte. So heevier things
Will never lull on lighher from above,
Nor blowe inflict sufficient to produce
The motione by which Nature cll begete.
