Τ. LUORE'l'IUS OARUS

&mo first seede of body end of mind

Are plooed alternately, eooh still by eeoh,
And weave our frome together. For the eoul
Is formed of emeller elementa than they,
Muoh fewer too, and seeteered through our fremo
In scanty numbers, so thel this alone
You oen loy down, thet the first germe of soul
Have sponoe in 'their midst ee large ae ere
The bodies that erouee in ne lho sense
Ol feeling by their motione. Thus el times
We do nol feel the 'duel upon our limbe,
Nor ohelk bbat’e ehoken o¹er ue, nor the mist '
At night, nor yet the epider’s slender threnos,
When we are oenght in them, nor yet hie weh
All twieled on our head. nor yet the winge
Ol birdn end flying down of plante, whioh aro
Almosl: too light to foll, nor yet the troad
Of every oreeping thing, nor yet each slep
Whioh feet of gnate imprint upon our skin.
So many then muel be the seede dispereed
Thronghoul our frome, e'en the soul’s elemento
Soettered ebroed el eueh great intervels
Oen feel, ond come together, ond linet meet
And then egeln roooil eeoh in ile. tum.
ΨΜ mino 'rhe mind has more to do with holding light
ΜἪἫ The bande of lile: it has more sovereign ewey ι
Thon hae the eoul o'er life. without the mind.
without intelligenoe the eoul cannot
Remein a single moment in our frome,
lt follows in its turn, depende in air,
And leaves the ohilled limbe in the frose ol death.l
Bul he, whose mind and underelendlng still
Remein ineant, he still hes life in him.
