Ι Ml ΟΝ THE NATURE OF THINGS

That is of mortal body must have been
Consumod by passing years, and fleeting time.
But if in all that time, end long before
These things of whioh all nature is oompossd
Have still endured and lived, then certainly-V
They are· with immortality endowed, ¹«

By the samo foros and cause, if they were not
Themselves endowed with immortality,

More or less elosely eaoh with eaeh combined
lllse would a single touch be cause of death,

, Sinos any fores suffiees to dissolve,

What rs not dowered with immortality.

,But sinos the primal elements are bound

sBy various ties together, in themselves
‘xImmortaL they oan stand the shooks of time,
§Until there eomes a forse that ean undo.

So naught returns to naught, but when dissolved
All things return to matter once again.

Take a last instance: rain you think is gone
When father Ether now has dasbed it down
Upon our mother Earth. Yes, it is gone:

But brilliant eornflelds follow, branchos grow,
With leaves upon the trees, the trees themselves
With fruit are ladon, so the raes of man

And beasts are fed: and sities, you may sea

, How they resound with children's songs around:
The leafy woods are full of singing birds,

The wearied herds in the rajoieing flelds

Lie down to rest, while from full udders flows

The milky stream, and the young ones at play
With tottering footsteps gombol on the grass,
with the pure milk their little hearts bestirred
