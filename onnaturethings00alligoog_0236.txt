v Μ ΟΝ THE NATURE 010· THINGS

What onos it bore, bears other things nassau*
neugrio And then on many portents earth esseyed
²¹⁰⁰& Her ’prentioe hand, in fece and figure strange,
Man-woman, ier removed from esoh elike‚
Yet neither: things without their feet, or else
Without their hands, or dumb without e mouth,
Blind without eyes, things tightly bound in one
By firmest ties, not doing erything
Nor going anywhere, thet oould not ev'n
Keep out of danger, teke whet heed required.
And other such-like monsters it did melre,
Portentous things, but all in rein her teil,
Nature forbed them to increase, nor oould
They reeoh the flower oi their ege, nor feed,
Nor marry. Many things, we see, must join
Ere rece ean be eontinusd; first there’s ioodr
Then seed, end means by which it is eonveyed.
mh ⁸ lAnd many reoes then we know died out:
Could not beget, or propagate their young.
Whete’er you see thet hreathes the hreath ol life
Twos erait, or speed, or oourage hes preserved
From earliest days: though many too there ere
commended· to us by utility,
Which still romain, entrusted to our ears.
The lions fleree, the savege beests thet roam,
Their eourage guerds them, es speed does the stag,
And orest the lox. But walreful dogs that weteh
With faithful heert, and all the seed thet is

* Os. Tennyson, Luerettus:

And torrente ol her myrlud universe
Rulning along the llllmitsble inune
my on to elesh together egeln to make
Another end another treme ol things
For ever!
