st Μ ΟΝ rna NA'l'URIl OF THINGS

Tell boughs protruding'from a living form,
Limbs oi land-ereaturas mixed with limbs of those
That live at sea, while nature too would find
Ohimaeras speuting flama with foetid mouth
Throughout the fruitful lande. Yet it is plain
That suoh things are not done: since still we see
That all things that are born oi certain seeds
And certain mothers, growing, keep their kind,
And surely this is by a fixad law,

For thus into our frama from all our food

Pass bodies fit for eeoh particular pertz

'l'hore they unite lit motione to provide.

Nature herself on the other hand rejects
Those that are alien: and many things

my from our frama unseen, impelled by blows,
Suoh ae eould not fit into any part,
Nor, when within, agree with and adopt
'l'he fitting motione. Lest you should suppose
'l'hase laws apply to living things alone,
Know they ara universal in their scope.
For as begotten things are all unlike,
'l'hey eaoh oonsist oi seeds unlike: not but
'l'hat many are in shape the same, but that
They are not like eeoh other as a rule.
And ae the seads do differ, so there must
Be differenda in the speoe that lies between,
ln the ways, the maetings, and the weights and
blows,
The olashings and the motiones all of whieh
Disjoin not only living things, but keep
Apart the land and saa, tho sky and earth.
roh:b ³ng Now mark my praoepts, stered by weleoma toil,
hghi‘r. t’Ilest you should think the bright things whioh you
see
