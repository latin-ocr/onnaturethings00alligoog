ΟΝ ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS

xlllldwdrhere brute force reigned. And so it is

The dread of punishment oft spoils the prize

Thai man can win. For force and doing wrong

Scin catch the doers of them in their net,

And ev'n like curses still come home to roosl3

Nor is it easy for one’s life to be

Tranquil, composed‚ if by one's deeds one breaks

The laws made in che interest of peace:

Idr’n if one hides it both from Gods and men,

One must not always think lo keep ic hid,

For many often talking in their dreama

Or else in sickness raving, heve been known

To drag to light of day crimes hidden long.
⁰b²gfi¹¹²¹n ⁰¹ Now ask what 1s che cause has spread so wide

ΕΜ* Through mighty Slates the worship oi the Gods,

And filled our towns with altars, and arranged

That sacred services be still performed

Such as are rife in many places now*

On great occasions, whence there comes to men

Thac dread which raises templos to our Gods

O'er all the earth, and forces them to crowd

Their shrinos on holidays; it is not hard

To give fit answor. Even then men saw

With mind awake the glorious forms of Goda

Which were in sleop increased to wondrous siner

These they endow with sense, they see them move

Their limbs, and ulter loity things that fit

Their splendid forms and mighty powers. They

give ,
Them life etemal, for they ever saw

' Martha thinks these llnes refer to the new culta introduced
lnto Rome, such as those ol cybele, mentioned ln Book 1.‚ and
Mithrae, the Sur-god, transmltled to Rome during the first century
—ol which there are so many traces on the Romm altars ln this

conon-y.
