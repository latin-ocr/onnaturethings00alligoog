Deloyr beneath the earth, ond oonnoh riso

And so bo born. In winter so ic is

Tho nights oro long and woary, hill hho day
Displnys his radiant ensign3 or again

lt moy be in tho years alternate parta

The flres whioh make the sun ariao and nhine
At ono flxod spot, now flow moro slowly, now
More quiokly, no that it would soem that thoy
Are right who say thoi suns aro dnily horn.

mot Tho moon moy shino when strikon by the rayfl

tho moon·

Tho sun gives forth, and every day moy turn

Her light moro io our sighh, ao eho rooodeo

From tho sun's orh; oi length whon she has
shono

with quito fun lighh just opposito to him,

And rising high above has soon him soit

Thon by dogroffl she must reverse hor oouroo,

And hide hor light, iho neor-or that eho glidos

To the sun's flro, through the orhit of tho signs

From the other sido: aa those would have ih who

Pioiure the moon o hall, that keeps ito path

Boneaih the sun. ''i'is held hy nomo again

She rollo along with light that is her own,

And shows hor varied splendonr iorih, ior yoh

Thero well moy bo another body, whioh

In horno alost ond glides along with her,

Ever oppooing and obstruoting hor,

And yet not seon, boeauro it has no light.

Or else she may revolvo, jusi like a boll,

Hali oi hor tingod with brightly nhining light,

And as she turno may put on various forms,

Until the port, thath lighted up, she shows

Before our oyen: then hy dogroos hwists hook

And bokos away the part oi the round boll
