Why should the moon 11 1111 to eut off
The earth from the eun’e light, to thruet her head
Right in hie wey, oppoeing to hie roys
Her dorkeome orb, end yet it should be held
Some other body without light 11 well
Moy not the seme thing do? Why oen't the 111
Weoried at 1111111 times put out 111 flames,
And then relight them when he’e possed the spote
