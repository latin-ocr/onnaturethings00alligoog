{l‘fflffl And since I've shown the world’e orb ltself
{fffiffik Is mortal, and that heaven had a birth,

And all that goes on in it, or must go,

Have to a large extent explained, now learn ,

What follows on. Since once for all I mount Ψ

The Muse’s glorious car* (to explain the lew

01 winde and etorme‚ which men cit say are dhe

'l'o the Gode above, who in their anger raiee

Tha tempest’s force, and when there comes a lull

In the fury) ol the winde, say they’re appeared,

And that, their anger gone, the omens too

Are changed3 and for the rest I will explain

What mortale see go on in heaven and earth,

With fcarlul minds all hanging in suspense,

Trembling before the Gods in foer, depressed

Το very earth, and all this just because

Their ignorance oi causes forces them

Το band things 1ο the Empire of the Gods,

And give to them the world’e sovereignty.

For they who've rightly learned the chs still
lead

A life oi ease, if they should wonder still,

On what plan each eventis carried on,

And most in those things which are seen above

In the ethereal realms, are backward borna

Το old religione seruples, take 1ο themselves

Taskmaeters hard, whom they believe, poor things,

Gan all things do, not knowing what can be ¹

Or what cannot, or on what plan is given

Set power 1ο each, and bounds they cannot pass;

And so by blindcd reason still ara led

Yet further from the truth. Such things unless

Yon loathe, and in your mind refuso 1ο think
