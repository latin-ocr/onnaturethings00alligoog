ΟΝ THE NATURE OF snmus

wihus destroyed was of no further use.

'fhen it was skins, now gold ond purple flll
Our minds with cere, end weery them with wer.
'ria our own fault, Ithink: 'tis true she oold
Wes foriure fo the nsked fremo of man
In those old days without their ekins= bui us
It heims not now to look e purple robe,
Broosded silk with figures aud with gold*
If we but heve en ordinary gerb
'l'o eover us from oold. Mon toils in vein, ”s
In idle osres eonsumes his fleeting years,
Because he does noh know whef is the end
of getting, nor how fer true ploeeure oen
Continuo io inereese; ’tis this be eure
Theb step by step hes sent our life tolose
Its wey upon hhe see, snd from the depths
Hes stirred the mighty bellowings of wer.
Yet still these wetohful guardiam of fhe world,
'l'he sun end moon unfiring in their oourse,
Shedding their light round yon revolviug veuit
¹ Have taught us that the seeeons still oome round,
. Theb things proeeed by plau end fixed lew.
⁸ mii Alreedy feneed in oestles strong men possed
ἓξὲξ Their lives, end filled the land divided ouh
And marked with bounds: the see wee all alive ·
With soil-directed ships; on hreehiee hesed
Oities hed helpers end ellies io eid;
Poefe began fo sing heroie fests,
Nor muoh before were letters first found out.
And therefore ’tis our ege oannot look beck
Το whsf was done before, seve only where
Reeson oen show some trees of what hes been.
So ships and fields in hillege, wells eud lewe,
