ΟΝ THE NATURE 01⁴* THINGS
¹ii'fwhi'hhen hoofs upon eho ground, ond soans

With eoger eyes the ploos nround, to see
If enywhere she find her missing young:
‚ The leeiy woods she fllls with her eompleinie‚
'lhen pauses, ond enon returns again
Pieroed ho tho heere to eho deserted stell
with longing for the ohild she sees no more:
Not the soit willows, nor the dewelod grass,
Nor rivers gliding level with their banks,
Oen sooihe her honri, or take away her pang: ¹
Nor other oeives still rooming in the fields
Cen then divort her mind or ease her pain,
so plain it is she seeks for something known
Pooulier ho herself. The tendor hide
With tremulous voioes hoil their horned deme,
The buthing lambe the flooks oi blenting sheep:
And run by nature ho their mothers’ milk.
Just so in oorn yonii find thoe every grain
Is still unlike another, ond there is
In eaoh o differenoe oi form And shells
Tnat beautify the lep oi earth, where'er
'l'he see with rippling weves beses on the shore,
’ The winding shore all edged with thirsby sends,
These el] ere mode we see on the some rulo.
Whereiore 1 say again thess seeds thus mede
By nature, and not ooming from the hand
Oi men ooeording ho e single stemp,
hinet oft be found to differ in their form.
m And henoe a reeson's seen why lightning’s fleme
'⁸¹¹ss- Oan penetrate iar fumher then oen ours
On earth oi pine: ion you may say that it
with its subtle ioroe is formed oi smeller ports
And posses ohinks our fire nannet get through,
Bom es it is oi wood and sprung from pine.
