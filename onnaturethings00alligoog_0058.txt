Nature remains unchenged, these fittingly

We say are accidente. Thus lime ilselfs

Has no existence oi its own, but we

By sense discam what has been done of yore,

You cannot handle ic, yon only know

That ic is there by motion of events

Or by their absence. So when nien discourse
of Tyndarus’s daughter and horfale,

Or how tho Trojan nation was o’ercome,

We must take cere, lest we cre led to think
These actual facts, since now thorace oi men
Oi whom they were the accidente ie gone,

Kindled the fleme which sank so deep within

The breest oi Alexander, Phrygia’s lord,

And lighhed up tho fires oi aavege war=

Have set iamed Troy on flames, when from iis womb

By night in silence issued forth the Greeks.

Do not exist, as bodies do, themselvea

Nor are they as a void, but rather spring,

In which choy one and all are carried on.
