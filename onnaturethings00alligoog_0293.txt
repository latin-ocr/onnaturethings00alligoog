And silver, when wo hold o oup in hend=
Lestly through stone-partitione oi e house
Voiees een fly, end smeli and oold end hest.
Whioh pieres even iron; as when the ooet
of mail girds round the men of Gaul. And storms
Getherod in oerth end sky oomplete their work
And then to sky end eerth return: end so
Yon feel diseese when introduced without.
Sinos there ie nought but is oi body rere.

Ἠῶ From others, do not make the seme epponi
mm? To our sensatione, nor yet oro they flt
For overything elike. 'l'he sun bskes up
And dries the earth, but meite the solid ios,
And on the loity hilis bids {iilud-up snow
Quite deep to diseppeer before his ruys.
And wex grows soit when pleoed within hie hest.
And flro melts bross end iosos gold: but hides
And flesh it dries end shriveis upa ond yet
Weter oen hernon iron thet's been in hro,
But hides end flesh it softons. Thon the olive
Delights the boarded she-goets just es though
It wore embrosiel drink ond notter swoet:
Yet nothing grows thet bitterer is to men.
'l'ho swine tho mor-iorem evoids end fests
To touoh porthmos: to bristly owine they ero
A bitter poison, yet sometimes they soem
'l'o give us es it wore fresh iiie. Yet mire
'l'o us is toulest fllth while to the owine
It is so weleome thot thoy wullow thoro
With appetito insutiebly strong.
'ruffi Ono point remeius to speek oi, ere I come
tuo whot must now be said. Sinos many poros

'l'o many things ere given, they must heve
