Pawed with their feet the air, but all in vain,
You saw them fall with all their teudone cut,
And heavy sink upon the stricken earth.
These whom they thought that they had trained
enough
At home, they saw in the middle of the sight,
Grown wild 'mid wounds and ehouts and fright and
noree;
They could not bring them back; and every kind
of beast flew all around3 juet as do now
Lucanian beasts‚ when wounded hy¹ the steel,
Though first inflicting many savage deatha
Upon their friends. All this 1 think they did
Not so much with the hope of victory,
As to inflict great grief upon the foe,
Ev’n attha eost oi their own livea, because
Their ranke were few, and that they wanted arms.

The use of' rron. by which they fashion looma
Nor otherwise can things eo fine be made,
Ae leaeh-roda apindlea shuttles, and yarn·beame‚
Still ringing as they go. And nature made
Men work the wool e’er womankind begun
To do so· for the man is iar abead
In skill, and far more elever, till the day
AWhen the rough country folk upbraided them
'iro such degree that they were glad to hand
It over to the women, and to bear
An equal share oi teil, and with hard work
Make hard their bodies and their hands aa well.

&Vm Nature heracli, the world'e artificer‚
First ehowed them how to eow, and how to grait,

Since berries end the acorne from the trees
