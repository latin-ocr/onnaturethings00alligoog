(which yet he cannot do, it elinge to him
Do what he will), and so he hebes himself “
Beeeme eho' υἱοὶ he eennot find what ’e wrong:
Whieh if he saw arighe, he'd leave ell else
' And etudy Nature'e lewe, since whet’e in doubt
Ie not our state just for a single honr,
But for eternity, where we muse pens
All that remaine to ue, when death hee eome.
ἋἪ Onee more what eowerdly lust of life eo strong
maog& Hes foreed us eo eueh dengers end euch doubts?
ΜΠ* There ie an end to life quite fixed and eure:
Deeth eennot be eeeeped: meet it we must.
We ever ere engaged in like pte-suits,
Nor ean by living atrike out pleeeuree new:
Buss while that which we orave, we eennot get,
It ever seems our ehiefeet end: and then
Ι Ἦοιι got, there’e something else, end always we
Are geping with the thirst of longer life,
Most doubtful what the future may produce,
what chance will bring ue, or what end'e et hend.
Nor yet by living on do we take off
A single bour from death, nor een we ssle
Δ partiale from off the time whieh we
Mune spond among the dead. So you may live
Ae many generatione es you will:
Yet none the lese eternel death will weit,
Nor will he be no more, lese long a time,
Who from to-dey has mede en end of life
Then he who died some menthe or years before.
