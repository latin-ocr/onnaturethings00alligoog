Eas pushed and pmkod them in a single mass,
Urging §heu on, they pour their soeds abmad
which give bho rosy oolour to the flames,
It lightons, too, when olouds are rare and bhin.
For when tho wind dissolves them as thoy go
And bmku &hom up, these seods must fall perforoe
Whioh form tho lightning, but it lightens then
Noiseless‚ without alam, with no uproar. ι

That mont tho air wibh sulphur3 these am signs
Of flro, and not of wind or min. Resides ·

Of heusen: buildings, ὑοῦ, ean feel the power
Of their mfft flama. This fire doth Nature make

Minuta und easily movod‚ which nought ean stop.

Just like a cry or voioe, it passos through
The melta tho bruas, and in a moment molto
Both gold and bross. Wine, too, oan disappean
The vomis stin untouohod, beoauuo its heah
Loosens all mund, makes thiu tho earthenwm

The wine’s first atomo. This the sun's great heah,
Rough ever hosting with its glittering fite,
Through years cannot effect: so much more mist,
So far more ovemoworing is tho bolt.

Wrock homes, tear taho boumn and mfters up,

Ceut down md burn tho monuments of mon,
