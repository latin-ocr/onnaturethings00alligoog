ww ΟΝ ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS

of us, it seems. Again‚ the earth when struck
By thunder suddenly shakee all above,

And thie it could not do unless it were

Olose tied to heaven above and tho upper air.
They eling together by a common hond

From their first birth, oonjoined together still.
And see you not how great a weight of frama
Our eoul supporta for nathir though itha,
Because they are oonjoined and fitted close

'Phe one to the other? What ean lin our frame
With nimble bound, exeept it be the force

Of mind whioh rules our mombere? Don’t you eae
What power a euhtle nature hae, ev'n when

'l'o heavy body joined, ae air to earth,

And ae the force of mind ie to ourselves?

erun Again the eun'e diek cannot greater be,

Nor his heat less than to our sense appeare3

For from whatever distances euoh flree

Oen reaoh ue with their light, end breathe warm
heat

Upon our limbo, they lose naught of their flames.

Nor is the flre contraeted hy the space

That intervenes. So einoe the enn’e bright light

And heat thus reaoh our sense, and cheer the
place

On which thoy fall, ite form and eize as well

Mastaura be seen: you cannot add to it,

Nor aught take off. And then the moon itsolf,

Whether it chaere, the world with borrowed light*

Or ehede it from iteelfi whiohe'er it ie,

Ite form ean be no greater than it seems
