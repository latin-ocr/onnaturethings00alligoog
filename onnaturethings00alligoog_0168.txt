ΟΝ THE NATURE OF THINGS

Ιν.. mm

Το hun-y past, their shadows leave bohind=

And mighty hillo, and rooks tom from their siden,
Advaneo and pass across the sun: and then
Some monebor seems to dmw up other shapes

And drag a paek of sturm clouds in ibs hrain.
‘¹²:1⁸¹' Now will I show how easily they're born,
forffl For over falling off and leaving things.

'l'he outer suffaoe still is being dischargod

And flows off things, and when it others meets,

As glans, it pauses throughz but when it comen

Upon rough stenes or wood, it is so torn,

No image it ean give: but when the things

It meets are bright and dense, as minore nro,

This does not huppen: for it oannot pass,

As it does through glans, nor yet be tom uuunder:

The smoothnoss of it makes that this is so:

And so the images return to us.

'rho Ark, hor melnnnholy voyage done!
Yon rampant cloud nimios a llon's shapez
There nomba& a nugo numano-agape

A golden spent to swallow!

, Of. Shnkaepem,Antonu‚1v.12

‘Sometimes ve seo aolond bhat's dragonnh.
A προω- nometlmes llke a bear or llon,

A tovena altudel, a pendant wok.

A torked mounffln, οι· blue promontmy
with tmen upon ἰ, that nod nnto the world
And moek our eyes wlth alr)

Hmnld. ΙΙΙ. 2:

Emeda. Do yon soe yonder cloud, ωε almost {n nup· ot
a camel!

Polonius. By the mass, and 'tls like a camel indeed

H. Methlnkn 'tls llke a wamel.

Pol- It iu buckod llke a wamel.

H. Or like a whule!

Ροῑτ vm llke a whnle.

And Aristophanes, monde, m: ‘Didnt thou 0'er ιω ι oloud
like ι oentanr, or a panther, ι volt, or ιι buln·
