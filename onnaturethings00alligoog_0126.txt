ΟΝ THE NATURlll OF THINGS

&Rugum their country heve betrayed, und ev'n

Their very parents, seeking to evoid

The reelms of Acheron. Ev'n es children isar
In darkness ell things, end whet’s ooming dread,
So we in deylight dreed whet ie no more
Alerming then whet children shudder et

When it is derk, end fenoy sure to oome.

This terror then, thie darkness of the mind

'Tis not the sun, the glittering shelts ol dey,
Gen dissipate, but neture's teos end lew·

&iffi *Firet then, I say, the mind which oft is oelled
'l'he understanding, end in whioh there dwells
What guides end rules our life, is just ee muoh
A pert of men, es hends, end feet, end eyes
Are part of this whole living fremo of oure.

Yet meny wise heve thought thet sense in mind
Is pleoed in no particular part, but is

Ae 'twere e vitel hebit of the whole,

A mere hermoniou's working of the perte

Called hy the Greeks e hermony; beoeuse

By it we live with sense, although nowhere

Is the intelligenoe distinotly pleoed.

Thus oft the body may be well, und yet

The heelth resides in no particular pert

of him who's well: just so they nowhere ploos ·
rho sehse of mind. oue wrong, 1 tuns esayam.
Thus olt the body, whioh we see, is siok,

While in another pleoe we oennot see

We ieel thet nll ie well: on the other hend
Sometimes the mind is siok, while we're quite well.

⁹ Lueretius deele llrst with the ‘enlmus' or retlonel pert ol the

*enlmn' whleh le dldheed through the body, end ls the oense ol
