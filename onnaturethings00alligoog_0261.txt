Our body's tabernaclo, wrought the ills,
By its corruption all things were deflled

That come in from without, however loir

They were: end partly thet he sew it 11111

And partly thet he sew it did beioul

With noueeous flevour all thet it received.

And so with words oi truth he elcensed their
hearts,

And put en end to lust and feerromeness,

And set on high what was the greatest good

Thnt ell should aim et, end he shewed the wey,

The nerrow wey,* in which, by wellring straight

y It could be reechcd, end pointed cutte man

'l'he evil thet there was on every side

In life, existing‚ ever flying round,

By chance or force, to nature's influence due,

And from what portels each must sclly forth

ro meet the foe z and proved 'twas their own fault,

Sed waves oi troubles tossed within the brea'st.

As children tremble and are full ο1 dreed

At ell things in the darkness‚† so do wc

Feor in the light, sometimes ot things which ore

Objects of isarno more then those which they

Dreed in the doch, end fancy they will come.

Such dread, such darkness oi the mind the sun

With all its roys, the brightening shafts oi day

Oennot disperse; nature and nature’s lew

Alone cen do 11ς therefore I proceed
