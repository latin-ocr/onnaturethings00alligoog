Kill men themselves, ond sirike their ostile deod
'l'he oountry round, ell these ond other things

I will explain, and not make more exouso.

Bolis, then, we musi suppose are mede of olouds,
Thiok, piled up high: for none are ever seen
When skies are olesr, or clouds are somewhst thiu,
And this is shown quihe olserly: et suoh time
Olouds gmw so ehiokly over oll the sky,

Thoe we might fancy all iis darkness deep

Hod fled from Aeheron, ond hed filled instead
The heavens' great veniis: so inuoh emid the nighi,
The ieerful night of shorm-olouds gethering up,
Do fooes oi bleok horror hang on high:

When that the shorm begins to lennoh its bolhs.
Very often, boo, blsok storm-olouds oni oh seo,
Lei down like streame of pihoh from heaven, foll
Upon the weves with darkness changed, end drsw
With them dsrk tempest full of storms ond bolis,
liself already filled with flres end winde,

'rhet ov’n on land men quake, and seek to hide.
Thus then we must suppose the shorm above
Renohes high up: the olouds oonld never hide ·
Ilsrih in suoh darkness, unless from above

'l'hey were built up in numbers infinite,

'The sun meanwhile withdrown‘: nor could they

dmwn

The eerhh with suoh a rain, that streems o'erflow,
And pleins are eovered, if the ether were

Nol piled with olouds on high ln this ease then
All things ors filled with winde and flios, ond so
Thunder and lightning roll on every side.

1 heve already shown that hollow olonds

Have many seeds of hesi, end many more

Get from the sun’s ruys end their glowing wermhh
