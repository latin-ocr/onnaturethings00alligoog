end ardent diseiple‚ end he determines to throw
round his erid theories the Muse’s ohsnn. The
wells of the great world pert esunder before hie
eyes, end the poet sees the working of things
throughout the void as they move elong, ever
making end unmeking fresh figures in their
aeonien denne He hed, es he reminds us, almost

e new lunguege to orente:
‘The rise

And long fell of the hexameter'

io perfect for the teslr. But no peius were to be
spered: he speaks of the

‘Toilsome peth to wetuh the long nights through,
Seeking the words by which, and in whet verse

Ι mey et length shed round your mind e light
Whieh will display to you the hidden things.'*

And again, speaking of what men think of in their
¹sleep, he says: 1

‘While we pursue our took, end seek to leem
What is the nature of the world eround3 Δ
When found, relate it in our native tongue.’†

But dry and erid astho subject wes he clothes
it with poetie ehem, end beeomes ns interested
in the motion of his eterne, es they olesh, re-
bound, unite end seperate, es ever wes Homer in
the battles of the heroes he commemoratos. Itis
touehing indeed to wateh the young eristoornt
sitting eelmly down amid the vices end eorrup-
tions of the day, end peinfully devoting himself

⁹ tlte ssuffll.
