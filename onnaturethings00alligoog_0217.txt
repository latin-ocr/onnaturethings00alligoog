m Τ. monnulus OARUS

v..
Do not supply the light perpetually.

- Nay, more, the lights at night, whioh are on earth,
The hanging lamps, and torehes bright with flames
Amid the darkness, hasten on lilrewise
By heet new light to give, they're quiok, how quielr

To fliolrer with their flames, end so the light
Uninterrupted is, and never dies.

So speedily by birth of newer fleme
Is the destruction of the old oouoealed.
So then we must believe sun, moon, and stare
Shed light from new supplies ior ever born,
And ever lose the flrst, lest you should think
They flourish with inviolable strength.
{33⁰2} And see you not how stenes ere worn by years,
2⁰35*ss High towers fall down, and rocks ean rot away,
The shrines aud imeges ol Gods wear out
Weary and worn, nor does the eaored power
Prolong the bounds oi iate, nor aught evall
'Gainst nature's laws? Do we not see beside
Men’s monuments deeay, the solid iron
And brass grow old, rooks riven from high hius
Rush headlong down unable to withetand
The force oi years, the foros of finite time?
They would not fall so suddenly uptorn,
Ii irom infinite time they had endured
The wraekful siege of battering days unhurt.*
h'flbgffl Look et the sky whieh in its wide embraoe
κ ’ Around, above, holds all the earth, if it,
As'some declaro, out oi itself begets
All things, and takes them baek when they’re
destroyed,
It must have hed a birth, be doomed to die.
