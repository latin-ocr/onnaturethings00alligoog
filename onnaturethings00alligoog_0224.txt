v Μ ΟΝ THE NATURE OF THINGS

Far, 161 from earth, 1116 glittering renlms above.
The plains 661111 down. the lofty mountains grew3
For rooks could not subside, nor all the parts
Sink to one eommon level'all throughout ff .
00 θ’· Thus grew the messivo earthrgwith solid 1161116,
And all the 6111116 to‘thevery 6116111 661111
And there remained like dregs. The sea, the air,
, The dre-elad 611161, all are left behind ·'
With bodies clear: some lighter than 1116 1661;
And ether, the most light, most liquid, 166,
116616 6111116 airy breeze, nor ever j0ine
116 liquid body with the heaving airs3
These things it lets be whelmed by furious storms, ⁸
Disturbed by wayward winds, while its own firss
11 gliding bears along with changeless sweep.
That 611161 een thus flow with steady stream
And with one 611611, Pontus shows whose flood*
Glides ever on and keeps 116 6611166 unehanged.
”¹⁰¹³st Novv let us sing the motione 611116 star-s.
11161,ἰὲ 1116 sphera 61 heaven rolla, 'tis clear
On either side 1116 air must prees the pole,
Hold it outside‚ olose 111 at either end3
Another flows above and reaohes where
The everlasting stare still roll and shine;
Or yet another 's underneath to bear
The world upward, as we see 11161 streame
111111 wheels and water-sooops. It may he, too,
That heaven is fixed, 1116 glittering signs move on;
Either beeause the 11166 61 ether ere

*cfi Shakespeere‚ 01111116, 1113.

Ι11111616 the Pontio sea,
whose toy 61116111 and oompnlstve 6611166
Ne'er 16616 16111113 ebb, but keeps due on
To the neposne, and the Honespont:
