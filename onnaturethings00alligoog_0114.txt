u mm ΟΝ THE NATURn OF THINGS

Thersiore il follows that hhey oannoi feel.
anii‘dh' Again, ifwe must needs believe that senso

¹⁸⁵mord Oi whioh mankind speoifioally' rs formed?
For sure enough you must suppose ihai they
Shaken with rippling smiles oan laugh alono,
Sprinkle their laos and oheelrs with flowing hears,
(lan talk of Nature and its lawe, inquire
what are their origins: sinos they ioo musi
Like other things, of other elementa
Consist, whioh in their turn are born
Of others, so bhsv nowhere you ean stop:
Yes, sure, whatever you may say ean speak
And laugh and think, I'll prees you with the point,
That it is formed of things that do the same.
Bueif we see that this is foolish, mad,
Theman, noi made of lsughing things, may laugh
And think and reason learnedly, although
Not formed of thinking, talking germs, then why
Should nol these other things have sense, though

From union oi things that have it not?

Μ ξω Lastly, we all imm heavenly seed are sprung,
ιιῐῖ ⁸¹⁸¹ All have one Feiher‚ and by Him the earth, ,
οι’ἱὶῐῖὶιιιιι it has drunk the ialling showers oi rain,

Brings fonh and bears lhe goodly orops and trees,

And men himself, produces too wild beasts,

Providing iood whioh makes them all to grow‚

And lead a happy life, and bring forth young.

Wherefore oi right she's hermed our Mother Barth

And what is born of earth io eerih returns,

And theb whioh oame from heaven bo heaven
aseends.
