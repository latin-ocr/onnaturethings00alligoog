A pissnr. oo io spook, is loo right down

From sky io son, round whioh the surges boil

Lnshod by ibo blowing windo, and ships that ore

Oanght in that turmoil nome in montoso risit.

And this takes plnoe sometimes when tho wind'n

Ovor tho wovos by strength of nrm andband:

And when the cloud io roni, the forno oi wind

Bursin forth npon tho soa, and minos up ·

A wondrons surging in iho wavos nround:

Tho oddy whirling round dosoonds ond brings

Yon oiond of pliont body down with it:

And having thrusi it, hoavy ns it in,

Down io tho lovel oi tho soa, the oddy ibon

Plungos imolf ontiro into tho navos,

And miro tho oreon with oeniflo noiso,

And makes io boil. Io ohanoos too sometimes

That tho oddying wind wrnpo up iisolf in clouds,

And gothoring from tho nir tho ooods oi clouds,

Aa though iet down from heaven, imitatos

And bunt, it vomito forth a whirling otor-m
