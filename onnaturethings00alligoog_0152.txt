ΟΝ THE NATURE ΟΕ THINGS

ξὀαηῢῗὴίυᾶοη this: iorbids that he shall be

The man to whom it happens: so be sure

Naught terrible there is in death, that he,

who is not, missry cannot leel, nor does

It one whit matter whether he was born

At any other time, when once the death,

'lhat nevar dies, has ta’en the life that dies.
mmmm So when you see a man diequiet himself,
wadlssllffi 'lhat aiter death his body in the grave
ΨΜ gilfflssffl lidaldt'sblasfldlnlld ddrleolfft'he

Does not ring sound, within his heart you'll flnd

There lurks some secret sting, tormenting still,

Although he says he will not feel when dead.

He does not act according to his werde,

Nor ev’n accept the principle, on which

They hang; he does not rid himself oi life,

But all unwilling thinks that something will

Sur-vive oi him For whilst he is alive,

If he imagine that some future day

'l'he birds end beasts his body will destroy,

He’s much upset: and no distinction makes

Between that other and himself, nor leaves*

His body where it lies, thinks it is still

Himself, and standing by communientes

To it that which he feels. He ie annoyed

That he was born a mortni, and sees not

That when death really comes there will be left

No other seli, to live and mourn his loss,

And standing there to grieve that he lies torn

By besem, or burnt in flames. For ii it be

An evil after death to be torn up

one is happy until he is no more, Ι. a.
