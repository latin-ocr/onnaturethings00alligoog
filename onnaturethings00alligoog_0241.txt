οι· wilh lond weiling through the sselde did they·
Summon the dey end sun, when roeming on
'Mid ehedee oi night, but sileni, wrepl in eleep,
Would weil until the eun wilh reey toreh
Brought light lo the sky: ior they from ehild·

hoed'e deye
Were went io eee the darkness end the light
Aliernete eome, end eonld not wonder then,
Nor heve miegiving, leel elemel night,
'l'he eun'u light gone, would hold the earth in iee.
Fer greater wee their eene leet eevege heeete
Would rob their miserable lives oi resi.
And driven irem home they oit would beke their
ssight

From roeky eevee eh eight of foeming beer
01· lion strong, end in the deed oi night
All feafful leave their leeiy eoueh io these,
'l'heir eevege gueete le oeeupy ei will

Nor then, mueh more then new, hed they to leave
'l'he pleasant light of passing life behind.
’Τίε true that often one of them. when caught,
Furniehed lhe beeele wihh living foed, their leeth
'l'earing him up, while grovee end woodo end hill·
Re-eehoed wihh hie groene ee he eurveyed
Hie living fleeh in living lomb interrae
These who escaped hell-ealon, leber on,
Holding their hande above their ieelering soree.
with piteoue eries would eummon death to oome
Until eruel peine hed n'd them oi their life,
Bereft ei help, unknowing how io eure.

⁰ Mr. Duff quoles Bleneo white'e line eennel:

‘My-lenone night! when eur nni parent knew
'l'hee irem repert divine, end heard thy neme,
Did he nol tmmble ter thie lovely hume,

'l'hie glorian· eenopy oi light end bluel’
