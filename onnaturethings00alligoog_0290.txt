n m ΟΝ THE} NATURE OF THINGS

Although his baama possess such hest above,
How ean he down below the eamh so dense
There boil the waher, ffll ie full of heah?

Still more when scarcely through our house's walls

Gan he forse heah to pass. What hhen’s the cause?

Oi eoursa the earth is parer, has more warmhh

Olose to the spring, than whai it has elsewhere,

And near the water there are many seeds

Of flre: and so when night has elad the earth

ln robes of dewy darkness it ai ones

Contracta with ahill and spongo-like squaezes out

Whahever seeds of fine ie has within

Into the spring, which straightway makes it hot

'l'o touch and haste. Then when the the risen sun

Loosens tho earth, makes ih more full of poros,

A· its warm heah merassas, then the seeds

of fire come bank to where they were before,

And all the waier's hest is in the earth.

And this is why the spring is sold by day.

Again‚ the snn’s rsys play upon the spring,

His throbbing heah the waher makes more rare,

Ii sends oui all the seade of heah ie has;

Just as it often sheds the frose it holds,

And ihawe ihe ies, unhinds ihs bonds again.
Qgggglgl Another eold spring too there is, o’er whieh

A pieee of how when held easta forth a fleme:

A pina torah, too, when lighted in this wey

Sheds light upon the werse, where’er the wind

May drive it. Just because there are the seeds*

Of flre full many in it, and from earth

Below musi rise up many such-like seeds

Through the whole spring, and pass sbroad in

And riso into the air, too few perhaps
