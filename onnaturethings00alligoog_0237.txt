&snb-{dete of berdon, end the woolly fleeke,
And herned hetde, all these ere given to men
Το tend end eere. For they heve ever fled
The reee of wild benene end heve eeught for 'peeee
And food obtained without bheir teil, for we
Stin give it in exehenge for eervices.
But those to whom nature gave noneof these,
Who eould not get their foed, nor give to ue
Sueh useful service, in return for whieh
We'd suffer them to feed beneeth enecare,
All these would lie e beoty end e prey,
Entremmelled in the fatel eheine of fate,
Until they were destroyed by Nature’e hand.

So that the power end force of eeeh een't be
Alike. This you may leem, however dull.

Have passed, eho bey ie nott for even then
In eleep he'll eek to euek hie mether's breeet.
But when, in years edveneed, the horee'e strength
And limbs now weery from hie ebbing life,
Begin to fail, then for eho boy it is
The flower of his young life begine, and elothee
Hie eheeke with eoftest down. 'l'his lestyou think

From men end seed of berdon-bearing horse:
Or scyllas with their frames half-fleh, end girt*
