And lestly, oft the oreehing of the too,
Tho fall of hail ie heard among the oloude:
For when they're closely peoked together in

Stone etrikee on etone, or iren: for then, too,
The light burste out, end eoetters eperke of flre.

More elowly to the earo thou those which touoh

If you should wetoh one felling e large troo
With exo of double edge, you see the stroke
Before ite eound oen reeoh the ear: end eo

Yet both dieohorged together from one oouee,
Produoed together by the sels-some ehoek.

The earth with winghd light, end why the etorm
Oen flach with quivering stroke. For when the
