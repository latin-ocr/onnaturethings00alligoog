v.. mm ΟΝ mn Nisum ei* THINGS

And other flgnnents ot ths feney add,

This, Memmius, is folly. What een we

Confer on blessed end immortsl ones,

Thst they should aught administer for us?

Or whet new incident could meite them wish,
So long at rest, to ehsnge their former liis?
Life it would seem lsy simis in deepest shedes
0f woe, till dewned the origin oi things.
Whom old conditione vex, ’twere stt that he
Rejoiee in new ones: but to whom thers’s been
Ne trouble in the pest, who’s led s liis

of pleasant esse, what could arouse in him

A love ef change? what ili te us hed been

If we hed ne’er been bern? For· he ones born
Must long telivs, ss long es plessero leste.
But he who's never tested love oi life,

Hes never been enrolled upon the list

01 living men, what matter hed he ne’er

Been born et sll. And whence egsin was first
implssted ie the Gods, the form in which
Orestion must take pisse, end men be mede,
So thet· they knew just whst they wished to doi'
How wss the power of atems first mede known,
What they could de byehenges ’mongst themselves,
If nature hed not shevm them what te do
And given a model 1· so from esrly days

In many ways thess stom being struck

By blows, end kept in motion by their wsight,
Were went te tresel on, end in eli ways .
Beeome united, aad test every form

Whieh they by eombinsties eeuld sffeet,

So thet it is not strange, thet they heve seme
Into sueh dispositione end sueh ways,

As ferm tire universe we see totay,
