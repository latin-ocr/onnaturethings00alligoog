Τ. LUORETIUS OARUS

hffiffughry kings shrink strichen with the tear

Of eod, lest some foul crime or heughty word
Hes reached its time, to pey its penalty?
Or when strong toree with violence ot the storm
Sweeps o'er the see the eaptnin of e fleet
With his strong legions end his elephante,
Does he not seek the favour oi the Gods
With vows, and trembling ask in preyer to heve
The winde ebeted and more fevouring galee?
But ell in veinz seized by the tempeet fleres
He’s carried none the lese to the shoels of death
So greatly does some hidden power oontemn
Our humen tortunes end is often seen
'l'o trample down and melre e leughing-stoelr .
Oi all the symbols ot imperial power.
Agein‚ when eerth ell roeks beneeth their ieet,
And eities ruined fall, or tottering stand,
Uneertein what to do in suoh dire ense,
What wonder mortel men ebese themselves
And leeve in things of earth the mighty powers
And wondrous strength oi Gods to govern all?

¹ {immi} Then eopper next, end gold end iron were found,
The weight of silver, end the use of lead,
When flro hed burned up rnighty woods upon
The loity monetales, es by lightning's stroke,
Or else in forest war among themselves
Men on their foes onst flre to frighten them,
Or thet led on hythe goodness of the soil

They wished to open out rieh flelds, and bring
The land tepentem, or to sley wild beosts

And grow rieh on the prey. To hunt with pit
And fire was used before they did enclose

The glede with nete, or reuse it with their dogs.
Whete’er the ieet, audirem whatever oense,
