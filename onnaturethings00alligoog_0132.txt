m mm ΟΝ 'fiili NATURE' OF ramos

In union through our limbs: now one gives way
And now another leads, that so from all

A single whole heremod, lest heat and wind
And power of air aeting spart destroy

All feeling, and disperse it iar away

By their disunion. Yet still the mind

Has hest within it when it woxes wrath,

And passion glsnees from the flashing eyes.

There’s the eold breath of air that waits on fear,

Whieh makes our members shudder, thrills us
through,

' And thers’s the light and gentle air, whieh goes

With mind at ease and eheeriul eountenanee.

But more oi heat they have whose passionate
beart

And angry mind give way with ease to wrath.

First oome the lione with terrifie foros,

Who with their roaring split their very beart,

Nor ean oontain their floods of rege within.

The ehilly mind of stage has more oi wind,

More quiekly drives ehill air throughout the limbs, ·

And makes their frama to tremble. While the ox ·

Lives rather on still air, hor does the fleme,
The smoky fleme oi anger rouse it so,
Pouring dark shadows round, nor does it lie
Trembling, transfixed with the iay derts oi fear:
It eomes between the stags and savage lions=
So ’tis with men: howe‘er reflned some are
By training, still perfores it leaves behind
'l'he original nature oi the mind in each,
Nor must we think that evil ean be torn

Up by the roote at onoe, but one remains
More prone to passion, and another ieels
More easily sear, and yet a third displays
