’1. LUORBTIUS GARUS
vnn-ess

Do nol find ouilet, stin the forse, olan
And violence oi the wind make their wey through
The numerous openings in the earth, end like
As with e shivoring make il queke end rook.
Just ss does oold when il invades our limhs
Right through, and sets them shiveiing quite
against
'l'heir will, end makes them tremble. Men thus
ieer

ln oiiies with s double-edged alerm:
Above they tremble for tho roois3 below
They dread lesi nature by a stroke dissolve
The esverns oi the earth, end torn in two
Displny her gaping ehasm, end in wild
confusion seek to ffll it wilh her wreok.
Yes, let them think, if so they will, that earth
And heaven will remein slill undeslroyed.
with guereniee oi everlesting life:
Yet now and then the onll ol danger eomes,
Applies to them tho stimulus oi foer,
Of fear lesi earth withdrewn from ’neeth their ieet
Be onniod to the pit below, thee ell
The universe undone mey follow too,
The jumbled ruins oi e world romain.

Whrdfflffi Men wonder that the see does nol increase

m By nelnrsl lawe, since lhere's so great a flood

Of waler running down, and all the sneems
Run into ih Add wendering showers of rein
And flying storms, whioh belhe end water belh
The see end land: edd ils own springs: end yet
They all when you compete lhem wilh the sum
of all eho sea will soeroely add to it

A single drop: so 'his nol strange tho sea
Does nol inei-ense. Resides ohe sun drews off
