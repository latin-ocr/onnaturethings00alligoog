ΟΝ THE NATURE OF 'l'HINGS

¹iiiiiuhold it ascertainsd that there exista

Some solid body, which can keep it in.
And that ’tis plain must be some union
Of matter, which, though all things ars dissolved,
May be immortal. If there were no void,
All would be solid: if again there were
No bodies which could fill their appointed space,
There would be naught but empty formlees void.
And so 'tis plain that turn and turn about
Body and void exist, since that the world
Is neither altogether full, nor void.
There are then bodies which can thus mark out
The space that’s empty, from the space thet's
These cannot be dispersed by blows without,
Nor yet undone by forces from within,
Nor fail from any oense: as I have proved.
For without void 'tis plain naught can be cruehed,
Or broken, or by cutting torn in two,
Or suffer loss by damp, or gnawing oold,
Or penetrating heat, which all destroy.
The more oi void that anything contains,
The easier when assailed it falls away.
And eo if these first bodies, as I’ve shown,
Are solid, free from void, they are eternal.
If matter had not been so, long ago

Κ Ah things had disappeared, and what we see

‚, Had been made new from naught. But since I've

proved
Naught ean be made from naught, and what's
once been

Oen never be destroyed, there sure must be
Original elements which live for aye,
And into which all things can be resolved,
