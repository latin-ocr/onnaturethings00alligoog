lv Μ ΟΝ THE NATURE ΟΕΙ THINGS

My words on wind. First then the body must
In ἰιο outer οιιιιοοο, which is still exposed

Most nearly ιο the air, be buffotod

And struck by frequent blows: ancl themo itis
All things are covered 0'er by hide or uholl,
Thiek skln or burk. ln brealhing creaturos air
Strikes the interior ιοο, οε it eomes in,

or issues forth Thus as tho body is

On both sides beaten, and the blows salve

By little poros ιο the body’s primal parts

And elemento, thero gradually omues

Δ breaking up. Tho primal elementa

Ol mind and body are alike disturbod

In their positione, Thon the soul in part

Is driven οοι, in part retiret within:

ln part is scaltorod round the bodys imme

And οαιιί unito, and mutual molinus make-

For nature blooks their anion, and tho ways.

So sense deporta deep down in closo aoeord
With all the- changes that have taken place,
Since thero is nothing ιο support the frume,
The body wuesfeeble‚a11the limbs

Are faint, lhe arms and eyelids droop, lhe lhighu
llv’n lying down suoeumb and lose their οιτοιιςιι.

Sloep follows food, ιοοοοοο, like air, reooivod ’

within tho veina, food has a like effoet3

That sleep is heaviesl which you take when full
Or tired. because ιιοι then most elementa

Are disarrangod, and worn with hoavy ιοίΙ.

On the same lines the σου] is fomed in part

Slill doeper down, ο largor part ἐ expelled,
mum-And ιο more mttered and dividod up.
vmggAnd ιο οιοιοόο putauit a man is bound

mm And has ιο oling, or whatsoover things
