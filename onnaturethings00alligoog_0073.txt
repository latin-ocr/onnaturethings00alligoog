„Qffih ‘But still‚' you say, ‘upon the mountain tops
ffffiffi The towering trees are often rubbed together
When strong south winde do blow, until a fleme
Straight breaking out, they burst into a blase!
Quies true: yet lire is not innato in wood;
But there are seeds of heat, which rubhed together
Thus make the forest blaze. But ii so great
A fleme were hidden in woods, it could not be
For long concealed ’twould make an end of woodo,
Burn up the trees. ow don't you recognise
That aa wc said before it matters much
With what things and how placed these primal
germs
Are held in union, and what motion give,
And in their return receive. 'l'he something may
When changed s little bring forth flres and flrsl
Just as wc see the words themselves are formed
of letters slightly changed when we denote
These flrs and flres each by a different name.
And onec again, whatever you may see
As patent facts, if you believe that they

Can only be produced, if you assume
They are evolved from bodies like themselves,

On these terms surely primal germs will caasa

Το exist at all, and it will come to this,

They'll shake themselves with lsughter evcnnore,
And down their cheeks and face salt tears will

flow.

It still more clearly: nor do I at all
Still fail to see how dark these questions are.
But hope of fame* has struck my inmost heert
