ΟΝ THE nironn 011 Thmoo

lhhffiihlious words expressing different things 's'

According 10 the sense? Ev’n the (lumb herde

And wild beasts too are wont to give forth sounds

Distinet and various, when they grieve, or 1001,

010100 rejoioo. 'Tio easy to show this.

When first the lips 01 the Molossian dege

So large and soit, begin to growl and show

Their savage 100111, 101 different 10 the eound

01 muttered rago with which they threaten then

Thon when they berk, and fill the place with 110100.

Agaim when thoy attempt 10 liok their whelps

With gentle tongue, or 1000 them with their 1001,

And enapping at them, with their 100111 held back,

Mako 101111 10 bite, though gently, then they use

In fondling them a growling sort 01 sound,

Quito different to the hay they make when 1011

Alone within 1110 house, 01 whining sink

With body doubled up, 10 avoid a blow.

The horse's neigh 10 quite a different thing

When a young stellion, strichen by the apum

01 winged love, reges among the 1110100,

And when with nostrils open 101 the flght

He snorts the battle signal, or perehanoe

When at some other time with shaking limbo

Neighs gently? hest, tho raoe oi 101110 and birds

01 various kinds, hawlrs, ospreya gullo, who seek

Amid 1110 salt 000 waves their iood, they make

At one time 1101000 veetly differing,

From 111000 they 1100 when fighting ior their 10οᾶ

And struggling with their prey. And 001110 01

011011κο with the weather their hoarse, oroaking
sound,

As do the long-lived 100110, and flooks oi orowa,
