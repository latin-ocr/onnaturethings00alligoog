ιιι-ιιι

At their last hour, that there may still romain
Matter from which the world may bc renewed.

These primal clemente must still remain
Solid and simple, in no other way ⁴
Can they have been reserved through endlsss tima

Adown the ages to renew the world.

ffiffiighg Again, if Nature had no limit placed

imiimi! Το its destructive powers, matter itself

ot ”iffi Had been so much reduced by age's wear
That iuture growth hod been impossible
Within a given time: for everything
We see is far more easily destroyed ·
Thau made afresh: and so whate'er
The long and limitless expense of years
With its disturbing and dissolving power
Has broken up, could never be restored
In time that yet remaina. Buhfflhjfl
Tharais a limittodestructiye force, ¹
Since cverythiug we see again restored,
And stated times ιιι lixed ior each in turn
Το reach the flower and blossom oi their life.
And add to this, though matter is itseli
Most solid, yet we still can give account
of softer things, earth, air, and lire and water,
How they are brought about, end by what force
They are created, ii you once admit
'l'hat there is void in things. But lacking that,
1f the first elementa themselves were soit,
How could you e’er explain the solid flint,
The unyielding iron: for surely they would find
No base at all on which to found themselves.
There are then elementa of solid strength,
of which combined all things ιιι closely knit
Together, and put forth their utmost strength.
