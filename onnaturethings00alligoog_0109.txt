Which erowns iis neck end head shows in the sun;
At one time it is red, as garneio are,
And then again ie vies wilh emeralds green
And corel red. The peaooek’s teil as well
When filled with light changes its eolour loo,
Against the sun. And sinee these colours ars
Produeed by light, they cannot oome wibhouh ia
And since the pupil by e kind of blovv
Pereeives or white or blaek or other hue,
And sinae it bools nol what the hue may be,
But what the shape, it sure is clear 'that seeds
Require no oolonrs, bul are reoognised
By houoh depending on the shape ihey have. ,
Resides, since no fixed oolour is assigned
To different shapes‚ and all the forms of germs
Exiet in any colour, why, I pray,
Are not the things they form, in a like way
Endovvsd with every eolour? Suro 'twere right
'l'hat crows in flight should white appear below
From wings of while, and swans in turn be blaok
From a hlaok seed, or any other hue.

The eolours fode and die: as if a eloth

[l's pluoked, the purple and the scarlet hues
Most brilliant of all are quite dispersed:
You may infer the shreds their eolour lose
Before they come baok to the primordiel seeds.

Sinos that our eyes cannot see everything

You thus may leam some things there are deprived
