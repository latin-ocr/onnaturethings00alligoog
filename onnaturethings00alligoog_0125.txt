From his inmoet heere: the mssk is torn asido
The real men remeius. Then everiee
And the blind love oi honours, which eompel
These metehed men to pees the bounds of rightr—
As pertners, or ss egents of fell erimese
Το strive by night end day to reeeh the eop
with teil excessivo, these, the sores of life,

'Are ehiefly fostered by she iser of death,
For foul disgressa, end biteer went ere sure
Quihe to forbid a happy, eesy life.
And rather ho be waiting, so to say,
Before the deors of death. And so while men
Driven on by false slarm would fly from these
And pub them fer away, they gain itesh weelbh
By slsughher oi their follows, end emese
Great riches‚ ever heeping crime on esimez
Follow with joy e brother's funerei,
Shrink from end fesr ¹the bosni their kinemen

spread.

'Tis thie same isar that thinning envy stirs,
Because they see another bearing power,
Nohed by ell, erreyed in bright renem,
While they ere wrepped in darkness end in diri.

· Some wear themselves to death beesuse they wish

· A statue οι· s titlezioft again·

From feel· oi death, diegust of life end light ,
Seizes on men, and witha ssddened heert
They do themselves to death* iorgehting still
This feerit is which brings them all their esre,

Pube {hagie te rous, burste friendship's closest
n s,

And tremples underioot what duty bide. ἶ
