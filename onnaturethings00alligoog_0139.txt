They would heve perished, robbed oi further yeers.
It often happens, thet before our eyes

A men struck by diseeee, es by e bolt,

Folle down, all foeming attho mouth, he moene,
Shivers, extends his musoles, end is reolred3
Breothes fltfully, would toss his weeried limbs;
Why is it? 'lis the strength of the diseose

Spreed through bis limbs disorders him, he ioems
As though he would ejeot his soul, just es,

On the seit ses, woves swell before the storm.

With pein, ond thet the vome-producing seeds
Are driven forth, end through the mouth ere borne
In one greet mess, the roed they know so well,

And so regeins his soul. Sinoe then these things
Are so disturbed by suoh diseese, end toil
