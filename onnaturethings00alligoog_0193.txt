These wounded limbs and bodies stoined with gore

Were long in vogno before bright darie ssew round3 Ι

And nature prompwd us to sbnn e wound‚

' Before tbe left erm learned to use the shield.

'I'o 'rest the tired body 's older far

Then d softeushioned bed, to queneh the thirst

Thon oupe. We therefore may believe these things

Whieb.for the uses of our life were made

Have been discovered, thet they mey be used,

Fer otherwise'with ell those things it is

Which first were born, end afterwards revenled

What was their uses et the heed of whieh we pleee

0ur limbs end senses. So· again I say

Yon cannot think thet they were mede et first

For thet for whiob we use them now todey.

snm ·Nor is it strange the body does require ·

In every living creature foed* I’ve shown

'Ibat bodies still in eonstsnt ssight withdraw ·

From many things, but most from those whieh
live;

For they ere tried by eonstent motion still,

And muoh esoepes by sweeting, much again

Is hreethed out through the mouth, when oft
we pent

In weariness, end so the body thinner grows,

Its nature undermined‚ end pain ensues.

So, food is tehen to support the limbs,

Refresh our strength by nnion with the frome,

And oheek tbe wisb to eet thet spreeds along .

through nll our limbs end veine= the moisture ἃ
goes

To every pert thet needs it, end the things

Which messed together melre the stomeeh burn,

The liquid scetters when it eomes, end so
