For wbet gives food end increase to the rest

Must suffer loss, end then increase again.
Resides, ii there hed been no birth oi earth

And sky, if they bad been eternal, why

Long, long before the Theben War, and Troy

And its sad fell, were there no other barda

'l'o sing oi those old deyei* or whither have

So many ieats oi heroes passed away,

Nor live on everlasting monuments

of fame enrolled? The truth I think is this:

The universe is new, quite fresh the world,

Nor long ago began. Why there ere erte

Which even now receive the flnel touch,

Ev’n now advenae ; how much is now being learned

Oi ships; not long ago musiniano gave

Us tuneiul rnelodies3 and letely too

Great Nature’s plan has been revealed to us,

And Ι, the first of all, heve now been found

'Po tell it in my country’s native tongue.

But if you think these things were here before,

But that the rece of men was then destroyed

By burning beet, or thet their cities fell

ln some great earthquake‚ or thet swollen by rain

Devouring rivers flowed upon the land ‘

And overwhelmed their towns, so much the more

Must you admit that earth end heaven will be

At laet destroyed. For when things were assailed

By perils and diseases such as these,

Hed more disastrous cause pressed on them then,

Thon death and rnin hed ensued. No other way

' t's. Horace, Odes, lv. 9:

‘leere fortes ante Agamemnona

Multi: sed omnes illacrimabiles

Urguentur ignotique longe
Nocte, carent qula vste sacro!
