What though the trunk be mangled, and its limbs
Torn off all round, the seul removed and dregged ,
Right from it, still it lives, and still inhalas
AEtherial air of heaven: and thus deprived
Not altogether, but in larger part
of soul, it lingere on and olings to lile:
’Tis just as when the eye is wounded‚ il
The pupil is intaet, you still ean see,
Provided you don’t injure the whole ball,
And eut around the pupil, leaving it
Alone: that cannot be without the loss
(li eyesight. li the eentre oi tha eye
Be touched, however little, sight is gone
At onos, and darkness follows, though the bell
Remains quite unimpaired. Suoh are the terma
On which the soul and mind in union are,
Ever united elosely eeoh to eaoh.
, ‚ roffi And now that you may know that minds and
souls
of creaturos still are born, and have to die,
Ι will pursue my song, song worthy thee,
Fruit of long study and of pleasant toll
For you it is to eall them by one name,
And when 1 epeak ol soul, and eall it morial,
Believe I speak oi mind as well, ae how
They both ere one, in union eeeh with eaeh.
