Tuming themselves eround, the hall itseli

Appeors to turn, the pillors to whirl round,

So thatthey sonroely oon believe, hut thot

'l'he rooi is threetening on their heeds to foll

Agoin, when nature rsises first on high*

‚The sun’s red benms with trembling shoots of
. fleme,

And lifts them 0’er the hills, those hille o’or whioh

He seems to stood, ond blozing with his light '

Floods thern with flre, they seoroe ore further off

Two thousand arrows’ ssights‚ or nearer still

A dort’s five hundred onets ι’ end yet we know

Botween them and the sun lie mighty treots

of ooean wavee, spread out beneoth the slry, '

And many thousand lande ore interspereed‚

of divers peoples and of varied beusts

A pool of water, not a finger deep,

Steuding upon the street between the stenes

Affords a view beneath the earth as deepl ¹

· As is the lolty voult oi heaven above

With its wide expense: so thot you seem to see
In it the clouds and sky, in wondrous wey

ι · os. statem, mutatu sonu, ses:

‘l'he sun nrlseth ln hle molesty:
Who deth the world so glorlously behold
Thet cedor tope and hills seem bornlshed gold: ¹

'rflhelley hos o beautitul poem, ‘On Rewlleotlons' embodying .

mmm: ‘We poused &neoth the pools thet lle ⁸

Under the forest bough,
lisch seemed us ’twere o llttle sky,
Guiled ln o world below.

‘There loy the glode ond nelghbouring lown,
And through the dorlr gisen wood

l'he white sun twlnkllnss llke the down
Out ol ι speokled cloud·
