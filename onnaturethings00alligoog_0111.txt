Thac living worma are born 01 stinking dung,
When 1111 moise ear'th soeked with 1011111111 rains
Has 1011111111 things change in 1111 same way3
Rivers and leaves, and paslurss 11110 herds,

And herds again 11110 our human frame;

Ayc, and from 111111 wild 1111111 100 gain their

strength

And they 01 pinion strong. And so 1111

Thai nature 111111 all food 1ο living things

And gives 1111111 all 111111 sense, just as again

She 1111111 dry wood 10 flame, and all 10 lire.

Now do you see what difference 11 makes

In whal positione sceda lney 11111 be ranged,

How they are mixed, whel 1111110111 give, receive?
unffi And 111111 whal1s 1111111 11111111 on your mind
11ι “fficffiu onoc And moves 11 10 pue forth fresh arguments,

111 uss Why you should 1101 believe 11111 things 11111 1111,
milano 11011. ¹⁸Are born of senseless things? 81111111111111101111
And wood and 111111, however mixed they be, .
Can never give us sense. Yet here ’cwere well
'l'o 11011 I do 1101 say 11111 cvery‘ching
Which is producing, can aiones begel
This sense and feeling= 11111111 1111111111 much
How small the things may be which 111111 produce,
what shape they take, how moved, and how
arranged.
Nothing oi 11111 we see in logs or clods:
Yet even 111011 we 111 when 1111111 grown
'l'hrough rein produce 1111 worms, because 1111 storo
01 matter has been changed, combined anew,
As 11 11 when living things are 1ο be born.
Nexc they who hold 11111 things possessing sense
From like are born, in 11111 case 11111111 chal 111111

111111 11111 be 1011, 111 sense is always joined
