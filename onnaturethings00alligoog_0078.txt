Lmen ΟΝ THE NATURE OF THINGS

01 matter leid up in infinite spese,

From whieh they might renew what hes been lost.
For us, deprived 01 food, the rsee 01 things
Westes, end the body pines, so all things else

Must be dissolved, es soon es mutter falls,
And is diverted from its proper oourse.
Nor een mere blows without together hold
The universe thus formed: they ean indeed
By blows arrest disunion in some pert,
1111 others come who eun melre good the whole.
Sometimes they are oompelled to beekward spring,
And so to give the primel germs a speee
1 And time in whieh to fly, get eleer away
From the mess in union. Whereiore again
And yet again Ι say there must arise
ι Full many bodies to supply their plene,
And 11 these blows are not themselves to ieil
f Vlhere needs infinite matter everywhere.

Or thet the heevy perte whieh lie beneoth

We see the imnges 01 things reflected
Upon the water. In the seme way too

Heed downwenls, end yet osnnot fell from earth,
