lhzirlnthe first to stir: beat follows then,

And then the power thst's in the viewless wind,
And then the air: then all begins to move,

The blood is stirred, and all the flesh responde,
It pasees to the marrow and the bones,

Whether ‘tis joy or something quite opposed.

No pain ean thus invade, no bitter ill

Thus reeeh us, but the whole is so disturbed

No room ie left for life, the soul itseli

Flies through the body’s pores, with all its parts,

Yet oft these stirrings are but suriaco deep,

And this ie why we still retain onr life.
rasamenta Now I would gladly tell how these are mixed,

And how arranged for work, hut am held book

By my native speeeh's poverty, but still

I'll do, ae best I een. Among themselves

These primal atoms move in unison,

That none ean separate, or leave the reet,

'Phough many, but they still remain ae one.

So in the fleeh of anything you like,

'Phere's smel] and beat and flavour, yet of these

There’s but a single bulk oi body formed.

Thus heat and air and the invisible wind

United make one nature, and that fores

So nimble, whioh can move them like itself,

And ie the cause of feeling to our frome.

This nature lurke within, is hidden away,

More than ought else, soul of our very eoul,

Just as the force oi mind and power of soul

Are latent in our body and our limhs,

Are formed of atoms few and small, so too

This nameless power, like-formed, is hidden away,

Soul oi our very soul, o'er all supreme.

In like way wind and air end heat must grow
