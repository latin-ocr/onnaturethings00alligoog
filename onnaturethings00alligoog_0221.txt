So song Greek poete of the days gone by:
But very. fer from truth. For firo moy gain
The day, when ite matter gothering in strength

From the infinite void eomes on: end then

Ite foreee fail, o'eroonquered in their turn,

Or else things perieh oll burned out with flames.

And water too, 'tie told, oneo won the day

And many towns o'orturned‚ ond when ite foroe
ι From the infinite gethered, by eome power

⁸ s Wee turned aeide retreeting‚ then the raino
V Wore oteyed at length, the rivere lost their power.

”¹⁶ mffl‘„ But in what wey thie gethered matter formed
W⁰r¹⁶⁸ The eerth ond sky and see, the eun end moon,

I now will tell in order. Surely not
By deep deeign it was, nor elever mind,
'Ihet atomo settled in their proper pleoe,
Nor wes it by o eonoert 'mong themselves
They fixed their ooureee, but it wee beoeuee
Atome in many ways, of many kinds,
Impelled by hlowe‚ were borne by their own weight
From time infinite to oolleot together-2
In every sort of way, ond still to try
What fresh they oould by unifflreete.
And eo it rs through mohsrwfide diffueed,
Trying eeoh ῐηοτίοιιμῐᾶ eoeh union still,
They met togetherkond those messes formed
Whioh were the rudimento of those great things.
'l'he earth, end eea, ond eky and living things,

, naseas Yet even then the circle of the eun

sauhte rod ιι Flyr'ng eloft could not be seen, nor yet

rssf'l'he stare thot light the world, nor see, nor sky,
Nor even earth nor air, nor· anything
Like what we hove, but a strange oto'rm ol things,
A mighty moes of etoms of ell kinds,
