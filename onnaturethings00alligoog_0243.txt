limingae in good faith; were't not for this

The raoe had altogether perished then,

Nor could the breed have lasted till today.
a Nature then bid them utter various sounds

· ,·’ ⁵* And use expressed the names oi things: just ss

'l'he inability to speek oft seems

'l'o urge a child to gestures, when it points

With linger at the various things it sees:

llach feels how far his own power ean be used.
Before the oali has horns upon his head

Ha butts with it when angry‚ and in rage

He tries to striks. The penthsrs' eubs, the whelps
01 lions, light with olaws and fastand mouth
Ere teeth and olaws are there. Tha rane oi birds
We see still trust their wings¹ and trembling seek
The suoaour oi their pinions. So to think

That any one distributed the names

To things, that so men learned their earliest words.
Is iolly. How should one avail to note

The names of ull things, with appropriate words,
And others iail to do so? And besides

Ii others had not used such words themselves,
Whenoe did he gettha sense to use them so,
And whence tha power to know what he would do,
And see it in his mind? siguin, one man

Oould notiores many, and subdue them all,

Το wish to learn his names oi things. Itis

No easy thing to teaeh the deai whet they
Must do, nor yet persuade them: thoy would not

Suffor, nor yet on any pretext bear
Strange sounds ο1 voiee to intrude upon their ear,

And all in vain. And after all is said,
What wonder ii the raes, in whom both voice
And tangue were found in vipoun, noted down
