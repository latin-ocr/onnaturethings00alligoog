ΟΝ THE NATURn OF THINGS

nm
What forne oompele them, whnt velooity
Ie given to them to trevel through the voitt
Do you give heed to nll the werde 1 eey,
For know thet matter, ev’n though oloeely peoked,
Doee not oohere for ever, einoe we see
All things diminieh‚ end by length of years
Ebb quite ewey, withdrawn from eight by ege,
And yet the whole stende ieet end unimpeired,
Because the bodies whioh depnrt from eeeh,
While they diminieh what they leave, inoreeee
The uine oi those to which they oome, oompel
sThoee to wax old, these to renew their youth.

Nor do they stay there, thus the universe
Ιι still renewed‚ men live end die by turne.

t x Some natione wax end othere werre, end soon .
The reoee oi mankind ere changed, end enoh
In turn to other hande the toroh oi life*

Ae runnere do.
οιιιω or But if you think the eeecle

motem& Oen stop, end etopping3 there beget enew
Freeh motione oi their own, you’ve lost your wey
And wender fer irem truth For einee they teke
Their wey through void it must be by their weight .
Or by e blow from outeide: when they meet
And oleeh together often they rebound:
Neris it strange eo solid ee they ere,
With nenght behind their motion to erreet
Thet yonmey see more clearly how these germe
of matter ere for ever toeeed about,
Remember in the universe there ie,
No loweet point, end thet there ie no plene

Where theee first atoma een et reet romain,
Since endlese epeoe illimitnbly epreetle
