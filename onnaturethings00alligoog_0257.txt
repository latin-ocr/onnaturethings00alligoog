Τ. LUORETIUS OARUS
v.. maun.

On the soit grass beside a running stream,

Under the branchos of some loity trea,

At small expense they led their happy lives,

Most when the reasons smiled, and summer days

Paintod the green grass with abundant flowers.

'l'han johas, and talk, and pleasant laughter oame:

It was the rustio muse’s day: glad mirth

Prompted to bind with woven wreaths of flowere

And leaves the head and shoulders, and to move

Their limbo but stiffly ¹and not yet in tune,

And atrike their mother earth with olumsy foot=

Whenoe came more laughter and more pleasant
smiles;

For all was new and strange and full of lile.

The wakoful found a solaoe for the sloep

That they had lost in drawing out new tonse

In various ways, trying the different tunes,

And running o’er the reads with eurving lip.

Whenoo oven now our watohmsn in the towns

Keep these traditione still, and now have learned

Το keep in tune, and yet do not enjoy

It more than did oi yore tha rustio gronp

Ol that old earth-born raes. For what we have,

Unless we've something known mona aweet before,

Pleaaes na still, and seems to be the best;

While better things, whioh later oome to ue,

Are apt to spoil our taeta and love ior those

’ Whioh went before. And eo they learned to hato

'l'heir aoorn fond, they left behind their ooooh
With leores and grassae strewn, the vest of skin
Wu laid aeide, although I well believe

Suoh envy onae there was that he who wore

It flrst was done to death by treaohery3

'Twas torn among them, oovored with their blood,
