iv lm T. LUCRETIUS OARUS

However suddenly, whatever thing

Yon plaee before e miri-or, there you have

At onee an image. So you reeognise

That from their suriaee ιιι perpetual streame

Flow texturas fine, and thinnest shapes of things

'l'hus many images are soon begot:

Their birth is rapid Andes quiekly too,

As the sun must send his rays ιο flu the world,

With light incessant streaming from hiniseli,

So likevvise in as little time must pass

Such images imm things, end then be borne

In many ways in all directions round:

Sinee ιο whatever part otthem we hold

A mirmr, then it answers beck at enee

With things the same in eolour end inform.
Besides ev'n when the faee of heaven hes been ’

Quite pure end bright, it suddenly becomes

O'ereast with hideous elouds, as you might think

Darkness had left its seat in hell, and filled

'l'he vaults oi heaven, in such numbers hang

, Above us faces full oi horror dread
'Mid the blaek night of storm clouds thet eolleet.
Yet none ean tell how small a part oi these

An image is, or make it elear' ιιι words.

Swffiffl ⁰¹ And novv‚howsvviftly1mages are borne,
em What speed they have ιιι passing through the arr,
w How quiek their longest voyage is, where er -
They take their varied wey, this I will tell
Ιιι verses that are few but sweet ιο hear,
As is the short song oi the swan preferred
Το the lond cry of eranee all seattered wide
Amid the southern clouds. And first sti all
We often see that thin s

Arm ere the sun’s light and its heat,
