And when the wind hes foreed them to one plene,

And ehed forth many soeds of lieet, end mixed
Ituelt up with thot flre es well, then straight
An eddy oi tho wind ie introduced

And whirle about in little spone, end so
Shorpene the holt in iurneoes within;

lte beet ie from o double somne : ‘lor first
'l'he motion makes it hot, ond¹then it tnkee

Heut from contagione firee· 'lhen when the wind
Ie heeted‚ ond the lire et length hee mode

Ite fleree attach, the thunderbolt mutuned

Splite up the oloud quite suddenly, the heut
Aroueed ie borne along, flooding the whole ·
With eonneeting light Thon eomes the noise

so loud it seems to orueh down heaven’e veulte
Which pert uuunder: through the earth is felt

A heevy trembling‚ rumblinge run throughout
'l'he sky above, ior the whole etorm et once
Quekee with· the uhook, ond maringe everywhere
Are heard. And on the shook there follows rain,
so full end heevy, thet vest ether seems

· As turned to water to be tumbling down

For another deiuge: euoh a flood is poured

lli-om the buret oloud, and violence of the wind.
Sometimes it happens that the foroe of wind
Blown hom without falle on e oloud thet burne
With holt thot’e fully forged3 end when it'e bunt
There lullo thet llery whirl our country'e epeeoh
Hes termed a thunderbolt. Tho same moy ohanne
Towerde other perte oeoording to the wind.

And sometimes, too, wind blowiug without lire,
Moy get on fine, when trevelling far: and while
It mosee, loeing in ite onword oourse

Some heevy hodia, whioh eeunot paee through;
