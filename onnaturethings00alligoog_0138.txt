1¹1„ Μ ΟΝ ΤΗΕ NATURE OF THINGS

'l'he nature of the soul goes too, like smoke‚
Into the higher air-since both we sse
Are born und grew together, es I've shown,

And both worn out with weight of years decline.

. 3 mmm And so we see, as the body undergoes
Wfllstlll n(lruel disease and grief oft hard to bear,

w The mind too has fleres cares, and grief, and

foer:
It must then share ln death. And then again
The body siek, the mind oft goes ostray:
It loses sense, ond drivels in its speech,
And oft in hesvy lethsrgy is borne
'Po deep eternsl sleep with drooping eyes
And sinlring houd, reoh'ned upon the breast=
No voioe it hears, no tuoe it knows of those
Who standing round would eall lt baolr to life,
Bedewing still their fore and ohesks with teors.
You must admit the mind then is dissolred,
Sinos it thus shores oontuglon ol diseose·
Griof and diseuse alike oon loshion death,
4· As many desths heve taught us well ere now
r Ηιιισα stringen how rs lt, when the strong fleres wine
we ,ις Is ιιι e man, and all its llery hest
W ας Is courslng through his velus, the body grows
oen as Quite heevy, und his limbs are hampered sore
ι My As he reels about, his stuttering tongue is dumb,
His mind is limp, his eyes thoy swim, while shouts
> And quorrels ond hlooups spread around, and all
'l'hst follows such a soene? How does it dome
Unless wine's strength, with all its flery foros,
Is able to upset ond disarrange
'l'he soul within the body? But when thus
'l'hings ure confused and troubled, sure they show,
If but a stronger cause hod stolen in
