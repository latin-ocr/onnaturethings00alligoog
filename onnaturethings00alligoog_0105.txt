Agein, whatever’e seton lire and burned
Storee up, if nothing else, et leest the meone
Το throw out flre, and send out light, end eet
Fresh eperke in motion, and fresh embere too.
If you'll epply like methode to the rest
Youll flnd they still conceal the eeeds within
of many things, oi very various shapes.
Agoin‚ you meet with many things thet heve
Oolour end teste ond emell. Their propertiee
Muet in each oeee be severally mede
Of elemento of different ehepee. For emell
Is found where oolour'e not peroeived3
Colour in one wey, teste in quite another
Affeot the nenses, so thet you moy know
They differ in the ehepee thet go to form thern
So different shepee ere formed into u mess,
And things ere mede by mixture ottho seed.
So in our verses many lettere ere
common to many words, although you must
Admit the verses and the words ere formed .
Of different elemente: not but there ere ¹
Many in common whioh run through them ell,
0r thet there are no two eompoeed the seme:
But thet for most pert they ere quite unlike
The one the other. Thus iu many things
There ere many eeeds in common, yet they make
Δ whole thet'e quite unlilre in all ite parte,
So thet quite truly yon may say thet mon,
And eoru, end pleeeent trees do all eoneiet
κ of different elemente.
Βηιιιιωιιι Nor yet must we
, Mlillddl suppose thet all things may be joined together
ΜΝ In every wey· for then you would errive

At prodigies, hell· uren, helf- beust, or p”reps
