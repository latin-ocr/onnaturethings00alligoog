ΟΝ THE NATURE OF 'PHINGS

¹lllhffidiliieople would believe? there could be nanght:

So wonderful the sight. Yet no one now,
So tired are they with sseing, ever thinks
'I'o gaze into the sky’s unsullied vault.
Oease then to be alarmed at what is new,
And so reject the truth: but rather weigh
These things with your keen mind, and if they’re
true,
Yield your assent, if not, then take the fleld
Against them. For the mind still seeks to know,
Since the universe is vast, unlimited,
Stretohing beyond the ramparts of the world,
What is beyond, to which it can look forword,
And soar away in free unfettered ssight.
mmm& First then towards every part, on either side,
‘¹²²¹' ⁰³¹² Above, below, throughout the universe
I’ve shown there is no boundz the fact itself
Aloud proclaims it, and the vast profound
Decleres it is so. And we cannot think
It probable, when vest and boundless space
Yawns everywhere, and germs in the deep
profound
In number numberloss* still fly around
In ceaeeless motion driven, that this earth
And heaven alone have been created, while
· The other atoms count ior naught: the more
Since Nature made the world, and these same
ger-ms
Glashing together of their own accord,
By chance in many ways, without design
Idly without result, at last by force
Have coalesced, and suddenly become

⁹ Of. Milton, Porodieelleaaimd, nl lm:
‘Ha lookcd and saw what numbers numbcrlesa'
