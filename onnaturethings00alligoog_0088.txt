'hulmo do goodly oropo ond trees, although

Whot weight they heve, would drew them down
to earth.
Nor when flree leop upon the houee's roofs
And with ewllt demes liek beeme ond reltere up,
Are we to think they do it ol themselves,
Without some foroe behind? Iu tho eome wey
Eeoeping from n wound blood opurte end springs
ΑΙοὶι, end eeottere gere. Do you not eoo
The weter with whnt strength it driven from out
Ite depthe etroy loge and bouum The more we
puoh ’
Them down, ond prese thern book with ull our loroe
And might ond mein, end many though we be,

And send them to tho eurleoe oneo egeln, ¹
So mueh thet hell their length ie in the εἰη
And yet who doubts thot of themselves they would
Be oerrr'ed downwerd through the mighty Void?
So flames, too, driven upworde still should riee
Το upper nir, although whot weight they heve

Would etrive to drew them down. And eee you ἵ

not
'l'he mighty meteore thet fly eloft
Drew efter them long troile of fleme towarde
Wherever Nature givos them leeve ιο go?
See you not storo end constellatione fall?
'l'he eun, too, from the zenith ehede ite heet
On every side, ond eowe the flelde wlth light:
So to the earth as well hie heut etill tende.
'You see the lightnings fleeh eoroee the etorm,
From thie side, now from thet, the flemee buret
forth
From out the clouds, still falling to the earth.
