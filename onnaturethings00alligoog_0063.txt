{liiidie singleness, whioh massed together

Olosely cohere by means 01 their least parts,
Not joined together by an union of them,
But strong in everlesting singleness.
Nature allows naught to be torn away,
And naught diminished‚ they are kept as seeds,
For future things, repairing those that die.
Resides, unless there be in eaoh a least,
'Phe smellest bodies ever will eonsist
of parts innumerous, inasmueh as half
Wiil still divide in half again, and so
No limit will be reached. What differenoe then
We ask is there between the whole and pert? ³
There will be none at all. However muoh
The whole is infinite, its smellest parts
Will still be infinite, eaoh one of them.
On this sinee reeson enters a protest
And says itis impossible, yet yon
Must grant thet it is wrong, and so admit
That there ere things whioh without parts exist
And are quite small: 'tis olear that they are there,
And must be granted solid, everlssting.
And furthermore if it hed been agreed
By Nature, great oreatress of the world,
That all things into little parts should be
Resolved, then out of them she would not hare
The means 01 reparation, sinae those parts
Would have no generating power, such as
Meetings together, wei ghts, blows, motione too
By means of whioh things ever are being born.
