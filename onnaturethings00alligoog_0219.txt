Do walzegm doomed to doeth, then thet our-

We eichen from the seme disseces still
As those, whom nature hes removed from life.

mjgffllfflg Again, whatever stende eternal must

' All hostile blows, nor suffers eught to intrude
Which could unloose the close-huit parte within,
As matter does which we’ve before described:
Or else because it laets eternally,
As being exempt irom shocks, ae is the void
Which unesseiled remeius and suffers not
From eny stroke; or else beceuso there is
No space around, to which things oen depert
And be dissolved as is the universe,
In which there is no place beyond, to which
They thus can leep apert end be dissolved,

The neture oi the world is not endowed
With solid body, since it’s mixed with void,
But not mere void, for bodies do not lech
Which gethering might from ont infinity
May overthrow this universe of oure ’
With whirling storm, or down upon it bring
Some other perilous disaster dire.
Nor is there wanting room and space, in which
The world's foundations might be scettered wide,
Or perisb by some blow. And so we see
The gete of death to heaven is not herred,
Nor to the sun, or eertb, or oceen’s weves,
But open stands with huge wide-gaping mew,
And waits its victims. So you must admit
Thet these things hed a birth, for things possessed
