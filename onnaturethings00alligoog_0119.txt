All bodies are distributod by blows

anh to hie own, eeoh to his proper class:
Moisture to moisture, earth to earth aoorues,
Fires light fresh flree, and ether ether adds
Till Nature, universal parent, brings

With perient skill its increase to an end.

This eomes to pass, when now there’s nothing more

Entering the veina oi life, than that whioh flows

Away and pasees off: then to them all

Life oloses down, and Nature stops their growth.

For all the things you see inoreasa and grow

With gladeome steps, and gradually reaoh

Το full-grown years, still take unto themselves

More matter than they lose, so long as iood

Is passed into their veina, and they are not ·

So widely saattered, as to lose their pa1ts,

And more of waste inour than they ean gain,

Τό feed their life: for sure we must admit

Muoh matter wastes and leaves them, yet there
must

Be other coming in until full growth

At length is reaahed. And then by slow degrees

Years break their strength, their vigorons growth
destroy,

And drag them downward to a dull deoay.

Yes, for indeed the larger their increase,

The more they spread abroad with growing
strength, '

The more the parts they shed, when growth is
esayae,

The less their food ean nourish and augment:

There's not enough, eo eopious the discharge,

'l'o reinioroe and reinvigorate.

The duty ’tis of fond still to renew,
