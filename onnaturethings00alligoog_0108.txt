You nssay perhaps say, when that whieh once was
Is mixed anew, ihs seeds in order changed,
Some added, some removed, tharthan it eomes

Was formed ol azure seeds, it never oould
Be white at all. However you dislurb
Seeds whieh are blue, you eannot make them

Of pure and single brightness, you would find
Quin varied eolours differing 'mong themselves.
The different ligures don’t prevent the square
From being a square, but differens oolours do

Is changed aeeording as the lighb may atrike
With straight or oblique ray. So ‘she dove's plume
