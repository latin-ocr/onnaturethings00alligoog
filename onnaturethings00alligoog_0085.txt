And lies imrnense on every side, esI

Have often shown, end resson hoo uffirms.

Sinos this is true, no roso is ever found

For gertus throughout the void, but driven on

In oeoseless worded motion some rebound,

Ireoving large gups, while some ore knit together

With hardly eny interspeee eh eu:

And these move closely bound with little speoe

Lockod oloso by their own intereanglsd forms,

These form the rocks, the unyielding iron mass,

And things like these: but those which spring
a}>m

Rebounding with great intervels between,

These give us the thiu oir, the splendid sun:

And many more there ore which wonder on,

Through the mighty void end find no resting-

In union wihh ohe rest, nor oen they move

In eloso communion with them: ond of these

1 note we heve an image, on ideo.

Alwuys before* our eyes. Look where the sun

Through some derk corner pours his brighton
boums,

A thousand lituo bodies you will see,

uix in the ruys, end there for ever ugho

Arroyed in mimio troops, uo pouso they give

But meet ond part again, nor svor oense.

From this you may oonjeoture of the germs
What ’his for ever in eho mighty void

To be tossed up und down. In some degree '⁶
Such small events may illustrate grean things,
And give o olue to knowledge. So ’his well

Thau you should noso these bodies how they rush
In she sun's ruys, became suoh rushes show
