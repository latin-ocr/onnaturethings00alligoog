tm d. LUORE'PIUS OARUS

Upon my verse till you atesim-thaphple
meonetius and ,1111111 has pessumo
{mg But sinee I’vs taught that solid bodias fly
For ever still uneonquered through the years,
Oome now letus uniold‚ if that thera bs
Δ 1111111 to their sum or not: and then
Let's sea if void and raom and spaoa, in which
All things go on is strictly limited‚
Or stretohes still immeasurably deep.
univoghss Well then, tha universe we see is not
infinite Boundad in its dimensione: were it so
There must have been au outsida boundary.
There ean be no sueh limit here, unless
Something there bs beyond to bound it, which
Lies iar away beyond our sensas' seen.
Now since we must admit that thera is naught
Beyond, there is no limit and no end.
Nor does it matter, where you take your stand,
Whatever post ons holds towards all its parts
One finds it infinita. And evan if
We hold all spaee is bounded, if one runs
Far as one ean, to its extremast vergo,
And throwe a wingad dart, do you suppose
That hurled with vigour it aehiavee its aim
And flios afar, or do you think its way
Is barrad by something that obstructa its course?
Ona view or other you must sure adopt
But either shuts you out from all escape,
And iorees you to admit po 1111111 is
'I'o this our universe. For ii there be
8011111111ιηῖἜόἯῖιῖἆᾶ 11 to raaoh its goel,
The point hoaimad at, or ii it is borne
Right iar away, in aither ease ’tis elear

It has not reached tha full extremity.
