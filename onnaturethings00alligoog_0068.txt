mm ΟΝ THE NATURld OF* rumas

Although you cannot see, there is a least

In everything. Moreover since they assign

Soft primal germs to many things we see,

Continually born, of mortal mould,

Since these they say are soit, it follows then,

The whole returns to nothing, and oi naught

The storo of things must be reborn and grew:

How far this is from truth you now can know.

Tbese bodies too in many ways are foas

And poisonous to each other, so that if

They meet, they die, or fly as iar apart,

As in a gathering storm wemften sse

The lightnings, winde and rains asunder fly.
'gyras Again, if all things are produced from four,
”¹¹⁸ 'iim And into them again dissolve, how can it be
nani iiiia That they are called beginnings‚ any more

Thau, ii the process be reversed, the things

Themselves might so be called. For still m turn

They are begotten, and their colour change,

Aye, and their nature still unoeasingly.

But if you hold the mass of flre and earth

And air and moisture meet in such a way

That by the union nothing changes, then

Nothing from them will aver be produced,

No living thing, no body, like a tree,

Inanimate: but each amid the mass

of varying matter, will remain itself

With its own character, and air be seen

Mixed up with Barth, and water joined with heat

But first beginnings in begetting things

should keep a nature latent and unseen

That neught may come to light that will obstruet

And so prevent each thing that is create

From having its own proper character.
