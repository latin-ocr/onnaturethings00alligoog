hm ΟΝ Tun NATURE Ol* rames

Thon it will follow that our'food itseli‚

Solid as well es liquid, is composed

Of something foreign to it, that' rs, bones,
Sinews, and veins and blood ell mixed together.
Agaue, ii all that grows out oi the earth

Is m the earth, the earth must be oomposed ,
Oi foreign elements, whioh spring irem it.

'Pake something else and you may say the same3
If fleme and smoke end ash lie hid in wood
Then wood oonsists oi alien elements.

iffi And here rs some slight opening for evasion,

21⁷1 ”effi Whioh Anaxagoras takes, and thinks all things

Mixed up in things lie unobserved, and one
guen ¹⁸ Alone rs visible, of whieh there rs

tmike most, the most ιιι view, most prominent.
But this 1s far from what true reason says.

If it were so then corn when erushed by ioree

Of threatening stone would show some mark oi

Or something else our bodies may contain:

Or stone being rubbed by stone, the blood would
flow.

Likewise the grassae too should yield sweet drops

Like to the milk in udder of the sheep:

When earth is broken up there'would be seen

Grasses and oorn and leaves distributsd

’ And lurking quite minute within the soil:

And last oi ell thet ashes, smoke, and lire

You’d find in legs when they were suepped in
two.

And since plain laet declares it is not so,

You recognise things are not mingled thus,

But that the gerrns common to many thinge

In many ways are mixed up, and lie hid.
