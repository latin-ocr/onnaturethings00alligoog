Will be extinguished, and all things that are
From nothing will be made. When anything
Ghenges its proper limita, that which was
Before, ir dead. It follows something then
Must still be left these lires oi theirs, or else
All things return to nothing, and reborn
From nothing grows again the store of things.
Since then there ere some bodies fixed end sure,
Preserving still the character they had,
Whose going and whose coming and whose change
Enables things to change and be transformed,
Know well it is not flre of which they're made.
'Twould matter not that some withdraw and go
Away, and some be added end some change,
Ii still they all retained their heatior all ·
That was produced by them would still be flre.
Butae Ι think the truth is this: there are
Some bodies whose chance maetings, motions,
shepes,
Positions, order, flre produce, and ii
'l'heir order's changed, their nature's changed and
they

Are lire no more, nor yet are like aught else,
Which cen effect our sensas by the touch.

fflfssffi Again, to say thet all things ere but flre,

Μ 'l'hat naught but flre does exist in things,

As this man does, what ie it but to be
A doting fool? Bsginning with the censes
He flghts against them, and denies their power,
On whom rests our beliei, irom whom indeed
'l'his flre to himself is known: ior he believes
He knows of it by sense, yet won't believe
The other things he knows by sense as well.
This seems to me an idle ioolishxthing.
