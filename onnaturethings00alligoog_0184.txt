ΟΝ THE NATURE OF umes

iiifflhers’ fingere: and the eountry 1011:

Hear iar and wida, they say, when Pan, heli-beust,
Shaking the piny eovering of his head*
With ourved lips runs o’er the gaping reads,
lese e’er the pipe should oease its woodland song.
Other strange tales and prodigies they tell,
lest they be thought to dwell in spots forlorn
Alone, forsaken hythe (toda, and so

Unless the openings are straight through whieh
They make their way, like those we know of glass
Whioh every form oen pass, are soon destroyed.
Again, a voioe divides itseli all round,
One hom another springs, when onoe a voiee
Is raised and sundered into many more,
As a spark of flre soatters its sparks abroad.
Places are filled with voioes3 though withdruwn
From view, they stir themselves and all around

’ The air is full oi sound. But images

Oi things when ones sent forth, these still prooeed

Upon straight lines, henes no one ever ean

⁴ Os. Wordsworth on the power ot sound:
‘The prpe ot Pan to shepherds
Gouohed ln the shedow oi Amadian pines,
was ming sweet'
