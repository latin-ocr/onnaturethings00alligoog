ΟΝ THE NATURE OF THINGS

From time infinite to the present hour
The mighty strength 01 immeasurable 11111.

Fight 10 among themselves, 111 1111 11111111

By unholy 01111 war, do you not 111

Some limit may be plaoed to their long 1111111
Perhaps when the sun’e heet hos won the day,
And drunk all moieture up, 111 settled aim

Not yet aooompliehed, so muoh 11 supplied

By rivers threatening in their turn to whelm

All things with deluge from deep oeean's gurge;
Yet 111 in vain, sinoe the winde that sweep the sea
Still keep it down, with the ethereal sun
Dissolving still 111 wetere with 1111 1111,

And trust that they ean dryite moieture up,
Before 111 projeot'e gained. So great the war
Whioh they breathe out, so doubtful 11 the 111111,

Engaging one another still 101 euch

Great ende3 though onoe, they tell, how 1111

Did win the day, and onoe how water reigned
O’er all the ilelde. Fire won the day, lieked up,
And waeted many things, when the mad 10101
01 the eun’e eteede etrayed from their proper oouree
And hurried Phaethon through all the sky

And 0111 all the earth. But the great sire
Almighty, 11111111 with rising wreth, daehed down
Preeumptuoue Phaethon with sudden stroke

Him meeting 11 1111111, 110111111 the lamp,

'l'he everlaeting lamp 01 the great world,
Subdued 1111 1011111111 eteocle, and yoking them
All terror-stricken to his oar again,

Renewed hie oonrse, subjeoting all 10 mle.
