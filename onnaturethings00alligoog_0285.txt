And yet we know 't wne something oi the kind,
And eo it is in many other thinge.

Mil* Tho Nile in summer wexee lorge end floode
The phtius, the only river Egypt hest
It wetere Egypt, in the summer heet,
Perhaps because nt that time the North winde
Blow straight egninet its mouth, the winde men

Eteeien then, They blow right up egeinet
The etreem end eo reterd it: ioroe ite wovee
Straight book end oense it to romain quite inll.
Undoubtedly these blasto, whioh first are formed
Among the ohilly constellatione oi
The pole, ere borne ethwert the etroem; while it
Comes from the heeted regione oi the dorth,
Rising 'mong men whose ineo· ere burned bleok,
Fer inland in the region oi midday.
It moy be too thet the greet heops oi eund
Piled up against the river et the mouth
Moy blook it, when the see driven on by winde
Throws up the send within, whereby the oouree
Of the stream beoomee less free, ite downwerd flow

Are driven to those perte by the Etesien winde
Whioh blows from north. And thus it seems the
oloude

When driven towards the region oi middey
They meet together, mneeed egeinet the hille
Are there eompooted end formed into one.
Perohonoe it risee deep among the hille
of Ethiop-lend‚ where the eli-illumining eun
With melting reye thet etrike upon their eides
Foroee the white enowe down into the plain.
