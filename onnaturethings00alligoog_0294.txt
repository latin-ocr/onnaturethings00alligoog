ΟΝ THE nerunt OF rumne

§22ssss unlike‚ end eeoh to eeoh ite own,

Ite own direction: ior in living things
There etill are various seneen, which peroeive
lluoh thing in ite own weyt for thus we see
Sounde paee one way, and in another toste
From eovoure, in a third the eoent of emeli.
One thing will stream through stenes, another
wood,
Another gold, another etill through breue
And silver; form ie seen to peee in thie,
And heet in thet dirention and more ewift
One goes then other, though the way’e the seme.
The various nature of the wuye oompele
lt eo to be, ae I heve shown before,
The nature and the texture differ still.

&¹333 As premissos before nefor our nee,
In what remeius youll eeeily see the plen, .
The oeuee whioh oen ottreet the toroe oi iron
And first of ull from out thie etone must stream
Seede, or a ourrent whioh diepele the eir,
Lying between the etone end iron there.
Then when thie epeoe ie empty, end mueh void
le left between, et onoe the iron etome
nan heedlong in the void in one great maes, ¹
'l'he ring then follows inite turn. and goes
With all ite body. Nothing hee ite perte
So eloeely intermingled eo in one,
Ae etubborn iron, with ite oold‚ dreediul feel.
So 'tie not strange my eeying from euoh things ἵ
There oennot gether many bodies from
The iron, and paee into the void, but thet
The ring must follow them; and thie it does,
It follows till it reeohee to the stone
