1.. 1010-1001.

By still eompalling Void to‘bound 0 body,

And body Void, so that she rendere 00011
111 turn still infinite: or else the one,
Unless the other bounds it, stretehes out
Alone, just as it is, immensurably.
But spaee I've shown without 0 1111111 spreads.
11 111011 the sum 01 matter bounded were,
Nor sea, nor earth, nor heaven’s quarters bright,
Nor mortal man, nor sacred Deities
Oould hold their ground ev’n for a passing hour
Since foreed asunder matter’s mighty mass
Would be dissolved and borne away through void,
Or rather never would have been combined,
Or aught created, seattered as it was.
For sure it was not by 0 set design
These primal germs then took their proper place,
01 their own knowledge, nor did they arrange
Their future metiens, but because they were

. In number many, changed in many ways,
Shifted about by blows through endless time,
Trying all metiens and all unione too,
They reaehed 01 lest 10 dispositione such
As now has formed this universe 01 ours,
By which it 10 preserved through the great years*
Whenee, 01100 110 1110110110 have been all arranged,
Ι1 makes the rivers faed the greedy 000
With the rich water-s 01 their rolling streame
And 001111 fed with the sun's heat still renews
Its produee, end the raee 01 living things
To flourish‚ and heaven’s gliding fires 10 roll:

. Which eould not be, had there not been 0 01010

⁴* The ‘meat years· are the 0001 trama· or Platonici, reekoned up

· 1. ,g 1110010 years, to be eompleted whenever all the heavenly bodies
oeeupled the 001110 planes 00 they dld when the world was meda
