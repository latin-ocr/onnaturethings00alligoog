vt Μ ΟΝ THE NATURE OF THINGS

MR? And now 1’11 toll you of tho Avernian* lakes
“¹52⁶ And places, what their nature is. Their name
Is given booauso thoy're noxious to all birdst
For when in ssight they come upon these sposss,
They fold their wings, forget their eustomod ssight

And drop ab onoe, their tendor neck outstrebched,

To earth, if bho nature of tho place permits,

To water, *if tho Avernian lake’s below.

Such place bbere is by Cum, where the hille,

with aorid sulphur charged, smoke, still renewed

with heatod springs. Another suohlike spot

Is 'mid the walls of Athens, at the top

01· ita famod eitadeL where stands the fane

of ὼε Tritonian Pallas, bountiful,

which ne'er tho oroaking orows† approach on
wmg,

Not even when the altars smoke on high

with sacred offeringsa sofar they fly

Not from the bitwr math of Pallas, for

Tho watch they ono day kept too well, as sing

The Grooian poete, but because enough

For them the nature of tho plaoo itself.

In Syria too thoro seems to be a plano

In which as soon as ev’n four-foobod beaute

'l'heir steps have planted, beavily they fall

Aa on a sudden elain in sacrifice

Το deicias below. Yet all these things.

Το natural causo aro due, their origin

Is clear enough, wo need not think Hell's gato

Is thero, or that tho infernal deibios

Draw souls below from henco to thoron's shores,
