,1, m ΟΝ Tun NATURE OF THINGS

enon Andthueitieweeee

How ier e thing 'e away. The more oi eir
nafflffinom of it that emm-our εγω,

So ior more dietant lethe thing wem]

And these effeote teke pleee with eueh e epeed,

'l'hetetonoe we seed-end een nogionis.

Nor must you think it strange we do not see

The imegee‚ end yet oon see the things.

For when the wind keeps ever heeting on ue,

When pieroing oold ie round, we do not feel

The seperate pertielee ol wind and eold,

But juet the whole result: ond eo with blowe

We feel them on our body, just ee ii

A something struck outeide, ond mede ue feel

Thet it wee there, or when we atrike e took,

We only touoh the eurieoe ee it were,

'l'he outeide eolour, which we do not feel,

But feel the herdnees'of the roek within
maim Now lenrn why the imege oen be seen beyond
„atii no mirmr, though it seems vinnm within.

'lie just the seme ee those things whieh ere

viewed.

When o door ellowe en open pnoepeet through,

And many things ere seen whioh ere outeide=

This vieion then ie due to twoiold eine:

lime there itone ineide the door, end then

'l'he folding doore themselves to right end leit,

Thon the outeide light whioh bmehee poet our eyes,

And then e eeoond eir, end then the things them·

selvee

Whioh actually ore seen beyond the doore.

So when the mirror’e imege flnet ie looeed,

Ae it eomes to our eyes, it puehee iorwerd

The eir thet lies between our eyes end it,
