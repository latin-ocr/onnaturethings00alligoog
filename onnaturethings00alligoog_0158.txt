Dresd tho great rook imponding in tho air,
Whioh novor falls: than does tho fsar of gods,
Tho idle fesr, oppress tho beart of mon:

§They fsor what ohsnos may bring ιο oaoh and all.
Birds do οὸι make their way ιο Tityus’ frome
In Acheron, nor oon they find within
His spacioso bresst, whorson ιο flll their maws
Throughout stornity. Howevor hugo*
His body is in bulk, ov'n if it takes
Nino aoros ιο accommodabo his limbs‚
Orthe whole earth, ho cannot always bear
Pain svsrlasting‚ or himself supply
From his own body food. But Tityus, hs
Remsins ιο us, who grovsls still in lust‚†
Whom birds dovour, and gnawing cars infosts,
Or other woes from other passione riso.
In life how often Sisyphus we sse,
Ons who is bont on soeking from tho throng
Tho rods and oruel axos, marks of power,
And, still refused, eomes book a sadder mon.
To soek for power, οι best an idle thing,
In this osse novor given, and for it
Hard soil to undergo this is indeed
Το foros up-hill tho rolling stone, which still
Comes book from mountain ιορ and seeks ιο goin
In hssdlong hosts tho level of tho plain.
Thon still ιο foed tho thsnkloss mind with good,
Το foed io still, yet never satisfy,

* Os. ΜΠιοῃ, Paradise Lost:
‘hls other oms beside
Prone on tho flood extendes long sud lnge
toy flostlng many a modss
† Mr. Duff quotes Klngsley:
‘For svor doomsd Ixion-like ιο rssl
On mim own possiem· over-buming whoel.'
