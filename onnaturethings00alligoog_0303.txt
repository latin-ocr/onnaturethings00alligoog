Eos the disssse's ἐπεὶ power would drag
Their very life from them. And fumas
which none ermedeo, end whioh none seme nesr,
Were hurried on in besto. No remsdy

Suro end of oommon use was found: tor onst
Which gese to one the power to teste egedo
'Phe eir of heaven, snd gaze upon ohe sky,

To othere this was death, end sorved to wing
The fatal derb. And eure so suoh e fimo

More to be pioied, grievous beyond all

It was when onos e msn peroeived himself
Eumeshed in fell diseese, es though he were
condemned to doeth elreedy, spirit gone,

He loy with ssddened beart, end looking doeth
Right in the fene surrendered life st onon*
And then besides at no time did they essse
One from another gresdily ¹to oetoh

'Phe foul contagion, like the woolly flooks

And horned herds. And this it chiefly was
Heeped death on doeth3 for if one did refuso,
Too keen of life, ooo timorous of doeth,

To visit his own siok ones, 't wee not long

But he did suffer for it, messing death
Himself disgreoeful, foul, and eli slons
without a friend3 suoh was the penalty

Of oruel neglect for him= buo those again
Who stayed by ehem, eonssgion oeught them quiok,
Assisted by dhe toil whioh duty fomes

'I'hem there to undertake, while tho gentle veios
Of wearied sufferers, with its pleintive tonos,
