Comes Heraclitus* ho che fight, who's femad
For want of claarness more ’mong foolieh Greeks
'l'han those more earneet ones who seek the truth.

Por stupid people still admira and love
ιτ 'l'hings which they see concealed m obscure words,

And think enac an ιε erue tna tiones weh t
The ears, and' ιε adorned with pretty phrase.

ΟΜ Μ’ Iask how things can e'er so varied be

tneor corr· If formed oi dre alone? 'Twould nothing help

If flre could be condensed or rarifled,
If it were in its parts still like the whole.
Thelheah would be cho greater, ii compressed,
Lesa with ihs paris dispereed, and scattered wida
More you could noh expect, nor could such wide
Variety of things arise from fire,
Denser or rerer as the case might be.
If, too, they once admit there is a void,
Fire then might be condensed and still leil rare;
But yel because they see there's much against,
And shrink irom admihling unmixed void in things.
Fearing lhe ebeeper road, they mise the nuth,
Perceiving not, if you remove the void,
All things ere denser made, and oi them all
One body is, which has no power ho send
Anghl from ic, as hest-giving llame can throw
Both light and warmth, and thus does leh you know
Thai 'tis noh formed oi closely compressed parts.
But if they think in any other way
hines may be quenched by unica, and change
Their body, if they this believe can be
At any point, be sure all heat ibseli
