Then first the earth gave birth to montel men.
For you must know much hest end moisture still
Wns in the fields, and where esch fitting place
Appeered, there grew up wombe attached to earth
By roots, nnd when et proper time the wermth
of intents flying moisture, secking eir,
Hed opened these,the1·e Nature turned to them
hierth's poree, compelled it from its opened veins
Το pour eweet juice like milk, ee nowadeys
Eech women when her child is born is fllled
With milk, became iood's current flows
Streight to the breest. The children, too, received
From earth their iood, their raiment irem the
hest, ·
From grass e bed with gentle down o'erspresd.
'l'het infant world brought forth no chilling cold,
No burning hest, no blests too strong to breve,
For ell things grew, end gothor strength elike.
„ffil And so again end yet again, I say, the earth
⁰¹⁸¹¹¹ Has won end fairly keeps e mother's name,
Since 'twcs itsell produced the human rece,
And et e time, thet's nearly llxed, sent forth
Eech animal that ronges o’er the hille
At large, end birds ol eir ot meny shepes.
But then, ee thet there ought to be sn end,
It cecsed to beer, es women do from ege.
Years change the nature oi the world,
One stote upon another state succeeds,
And nought is what it was: nothing remeius, .
Nature compels eternel change end flow.
For this thing rots, end feeble grows with years,
But that one coines to fame, no more contemned.
For years can change the nature oi the world,

One stete succeeds another, earth csn’t bear
