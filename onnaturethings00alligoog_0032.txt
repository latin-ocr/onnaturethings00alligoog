Man in ns early sagos, though nares ans s
unarmed, was strong and vigorous3 he had to
fight ior bare existence, lived on such fruit as
earth produced, and waged a watinual struggle
against wild bansta and other 1000. Then dis·
coveries mark his gradual advance= he learns to
clotho himself, to make himself a hut to dwell
in, and last, and most important, to light a flre
ior warmth. Then by degrees their habits become
less wilde men and women live together in one
family and have children, the weak are protected,
law and custom come into force, civilisation has
begun. It is the Oontract Social 01 1101100000, who
followed Lucretius closely in his Diacoura aar

The discovery 01 fire and its use for melting
metals gives rise to industries, men till the soil,
the various arts and scienoes follow in their turn:
they begin to dwell in towns, and ships sail upon
the sea. Lucretius was clearly 0110 of the first to
trace the progress oi the human rece, a fact for
which perhaps he has not received all the credit

he deserves. virgil recognised his velue when he
sang 01 him:

‘He sung the secret seads 01 Nature's frame—
How seas, and earth, and air, and active fleme
Fell through the mighty void, and in their fall

’ Were blindly gathored in this goodly beli ¹
The tender soil then stiffening by degrees
Shut irom the bounding earth the bounding
scas.

And a new sun to a new world arose.
