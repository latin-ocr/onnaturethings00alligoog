And furthermore 'tis sure there nothing is
Oi which you oen affirm 'tis not a void
Nor yet a solid body, whioh might form
As 'twere e seperate dement, e third.
Whetever is, must still be something sure:
If it admit oi touch, however small,
And be inoreesed in lerge or small degree,
So long os itis there, it must eularge -
The body’s sizo, and so increase tho whole.
But ii you cannot touoh it, end it een't
Provent things passing through it in their course,
Then here you heve what we oell void. Besides,
whatever is hes something iixed to do,
Or suffers from whet others do to it,
Oris the medium in whioh they live:
But neught thet hee no body e’er een eot,
Nor yet be acted ou, nor oen there bo
For aetion room, unless there is s void.
Thereiore be sure, that no third element
Exists in nature, but these two alone,
A body sud s void, none that our sense
Can seize et eny time, or we eeu gresp·
In any wey by reusoning of our mind.
