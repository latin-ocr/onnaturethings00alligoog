INTRODUOPION

himselftook a considerable part in the politleal
liie oi the State, having been tribune in 66 no
and praetor in 58 no. On this latter oeoasion he
opposed the plans oi Julius cesar, and itis in
reference to this that we have an allusion in the
poem when it says:

‘Nor yet ean Memmius’ son
At suoh an hour be wanting to the stata'* ’

It was probably aiter his praetorship that he
was assigned the province oi Bithynia, whither he
was aooompaniod by the poet Catullus, who gives
a not very favourable account oi his life and
eharaoter. In 54 aa. he was a candidate ior the
offloe oi Consul, and being aooused oi bribery was
exiled and afterwards lived at Athens. We bave
a letter* irom Gieero to him, whioh goes to show
that he was not a very ardent follower oi
Epiruma, though he perhaps adopted the more
pleasant and easygoing oi the great master's ·
tenete. Aooording to Oioero's letter be had
seoured a lease from the Areopagua at Athens,
oi “some tumbledown house or other oi Epi·
eurus ” (neseio quid illud Elpieuri parietinarum) ior
the purpose oi ereeting on it a residente ior
himself. The Soeiety oi Epicureane objected.
They said the buildings in question had been leit
to thern in perpetuity, and requested the good
eervices oi (licere to induee Memmius to surrender
them. l'heir earnestnese‚ he says, is rather laugh-
able, but they are an innocent, simple-minded
set, and we should indulge them, ior their error,
such as it is, is one oi eilliness, not knavery.
