iffi& ⁴ Thus sometimes, to your-seli you ought to say,
,332 {¹¹33 ‘Good Annus* too hes olosed his eyes on life:
ΜΝ· Μ Who wes by for e better men then you

In many things, unreesonable man.

Thon many other kings end potentates

Hov'e diod, who mighty empires ruled, Ev'n hei
who erstwhile mede his wey upon the deep,
And opened out e pethwey ior his troops

And mede them poss on ioot the salt sea pools,
And trompled them beneeth his horse⁸s ieet,
With blinded eyes, leid down his soul et lest
The Scipio's son,i the thunderbolt of war,

'l'he dread of Oerthoge, gave his bones to earth
As though he wore e slave. Add too to these
The inventore of the soienoes end erte,

The oompenions of the Helieonien meids,

Of whom great Homer, sitting all elone,

The peerless Homer, holds his seeptro high,
And yet he sleeps the sleep of eil the rest. ο
Democritus, when ripe old ege hed werned,

The movement of his mind hed slower grown,
of his own will offered his heed to death.

htv’n Epicurus died: the light oi life

Hod run its oourse for him, who fer surpessed
All men in intelleet, outshone them all, ’

As in the heavens the sun outshines the sters.
Yet still you doubt, oud still ere loth to goi
Whose life ‘s e living death, while yet you live

‘Quem juxto sequitur jactantior Auens
Nune quoque jem nimium gaudens popularibus ouris'

Soipio Α. Minor, who took Ger-thuge, 140 nc. Vir-gil, AEneid,
