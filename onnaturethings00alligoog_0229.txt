n the same way the moon and sters which roll
Vast years in mighty orbita, we must think.
By opposing airs are moved alternately.
Do you not see how stirred by varying winde
The lower clouds oft move in ways opposed
To those above? Why should the stars not be
Borne on through mighty orbita in the air
By different currente, as the others are?
nunc Night shrouds the earth in darkness, either when
After long course the weary sun has reached
The heaven'e last bounds‚ blown out his siuking
flres
Exhausted by their traval, worn away
By passage through the air, or else because
The ioroe which bore his orb above the earth,
Now makes him change his course and pass be
naath
Ι newa Likewise at a flxed time Matuta* sends
⁴ The roseate dawn through heaven's coasts, and
spreade
The light, either because the aelf-same sun
Returning 'naath the earth, seinos the sky
Before his time, and hastae to light his rayet
Or else because the flres together come,
And many partiales of heat unite,
At a flxed bour, which in their turn bring forth
Frssh light of eun continually renewed:
Ev’n aa they tell from Ida’s loity height
Are seen, when light begins, dispersbd fires,
Which gatharing in one bell make upa globe.

⁹ Matuta was the Goddess ol Dawn. Homer's temous epltbet
ls ‘the may-lingered dawn'3 and Milton, Pamdiae Lbet, xl 17³:

‘See the mern brings
Her may pmgress smillng!
