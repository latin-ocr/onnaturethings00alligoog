All things ere moving through e mighty void.

Comes into vie'w the mejesty oi gods*

In quiet abodee, where never eomes the storm,
No clouds to dreneh with rain, no snow oongeeled
By bitter frost to herm with ioy fell.

A oloudless sky still shelters them, end smiles

With light diffused around. Nature supplies

Them ell they need3 end nothing e'er ean mer
Their peeoe of mind, while on the other hand
,Dreed theron's mensione nowhere oen be seen

And death ie never found in thet ebode.

Nor yet does earth prevent us seeing ell
whatever posses through the mighty void
Beneath our feet. And when these things 1 see
A Godlike pleesnre mixed with owe Ι feel,
That nature thus by ell thy ert leid bere
Stends now reveeled on every side to men.
