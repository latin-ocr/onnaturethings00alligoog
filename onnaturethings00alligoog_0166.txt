mm ΟΝ mn NATURE ΟΕ· THINGS

In robes oi θιοιο, and make them danos about
In their own colours. And themora ἰι seems
'l'he theatro is compasshd with walls,

The more do all things laugh and smila within,
wilh beauty flooded, while the light oi day

Is close shut οιιι. If sheets ol canvas then
Gan thus ehed mmmmm-0 round,
Then‘offlsffffifflffewlseffoms‘offirge
From off effi? summm ssis same.
So ¹2OE we have eho traces of these forms,
Which fly about of bhinnest [seffora made,

So chin sgffieyca‘ffiiot separately be seen.

Among ”chamaan and smoke and heah as well
As other things, come forth diffused from things,
Quite chin, because ιιι coming from below
They’re torn within the winding passages,

Nor are there exite ior them ιο escape

In solid mass. Βοι, on the other hand,

When a thiu fllm of colour from the top

Is sent off, there is noughi ιο injure it,

Since it is ready ιο the hand, and lies

Upon the sur-iace. Lesb oi all, whace’er

of images there may appear ιο us

ln minora, waher, or bright suriaces,

Be sure, since they are formed in similar ways,
And like the things themselves, chat ihey are made
of hhe thing's images. There are then forms
Minuee and images oi things themselves

Which individually none can see,
Βιιι which thrown back, and constantly relicom,

Give back a likeness chat we all can see

From the mirror's suriaco: in no other way
Can they be kept so per-feccly entire,

Thai figures like each thing are formed in turn.
