The-¹¹1²& ”llllffflpathless ways the Muses lovel stray,

Untrod by foot of man, and love to approach
The untasted springs and drink, and eull fresh

flowors

¹ And gathor for my brows a glorious erown
with which the Muses in the days gone by

Have never deoked the brows of any man.
This first because my thome is great, and 1
For object have to free mon’s minda from fear
of the bonde religione seruples have imposed.
And next because Ι pen such lueid lines

On matters hard, and serious, and attempt

To deok my poema with tho 'Muse's eharm.
That too would soom to me a useful task.
Foras physioians when they have to give
Some naufieous draught bo children, smear tho edge
Around the cup with the sweeb yellow juiee ⁴
of honey, that their unsuspeoting yoam

May thus be duped‚ as far as lips can be,

And so may swallow down the bitter draught
And though deeoived, yet be noss quito betrayed,
But by such means recruited strength regain.
So I now since this toaohing seems to be -
Bitter to those who have not handled it,

And the oommon herd παπ back on soeing it,
Ι have resolved to explain our plan to you

In sweet Pi'erian verse, and smear it o'er

with the swoot honoy of the Muses’ song,
