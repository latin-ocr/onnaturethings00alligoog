Lm ΟΝ THE NATURIl OF THINGS

Nothing could move, for os a body hes

For fonction still to hindsr and obstruet,

It would do so in every cose, end then

No progress could be mede, since nothing would

Be first to make e way. But now on see,

On lend, end in the heaven's heights above

Our eyes behold things move in meny weys

Which were there not a void, would not so much

Lack stir end motion, es that they would ne’er

Have been at all, but closely pressed together

Would have remained at rest the eges through.

Resides, although things solid seem tc us,

· You yet may see they ere of body fine.

In rocks end caves the moisture oozes through,

And ell is dripping wet: food mekes its way

Throughout our bodies: trees cen melre their
growth,

And in due time beer fruit, because their food

Is still from deepost roots to brenoh end stem

Dispersed right through: then noises oreep through
wells,

And through closed doors are heard: the frosty
cold

Can resch our bones: were there no void et all,
However could they poss? Why, never then
Could they exist et all. And why, Ι ask,

Is this of greater weight then thet, although

In sire no larger? if there be es much
of body in e ball oi wool, as in

A lump of lead, why they should weigh the seme:
A body presses all things close together,

A void is without weight, end therefore ii

A thing as large is lighter, 'tis a proof

'l'het it contains mors void: iiheevier,
