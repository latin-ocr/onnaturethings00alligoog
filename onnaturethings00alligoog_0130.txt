ΟΝ nm NATURE ol· THINGS

mugit in might: death leaves it just the

same,
Savo in tho vital sense, and in the hear„
And so thQAEQUJ maniaticiminuoe-mds

For* when ἰιέ left the body, still the limbs
Romaiu tho same in ouiward measummnnt,
And not a grain is lost in might„ Just as
When wine hos lost its bouquet. or the sueni
of a pleasant periumo is diffusod in air,
Or something else hoa Ιοει its flavour, yet·
The thing does not look smaller ιο the eye,
Nor ought has lost in weightz and just beaune ·
Thero are many atoma small and most minute
Ι Το give ο iuste and flavour ιο tho whole.
And so again and yet again 1 say tho mi'nd
And soul of such small seoda ar& surely formed,
Sinoe when ἰι goes no woighi οι all is lost.
Ἥβῃ Yet you must not suppose its nature is
Quite simple. For οι death a gentle breath,
Mingled with ιιοοι, tho dying body leaves.
The hott implius there’s air: for without air
Heat <annot bo: ior heat by nature rare
Musi still with air bo mixed. And so wo find
'l'he nature-of the mind is threefold: yet '
, Ev'n these aro not enough ιο give us se'nso.
Sinoe facts have siiewq that ,none oi thim ean

Naught is more nimble or more rare than it:
More formed of smooth small parts: ἰἰε this which
