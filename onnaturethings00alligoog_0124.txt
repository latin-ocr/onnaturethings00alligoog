m Μ ΟΝ THE NATURE' OF THINGS

The dread oi Acheron heodlong driven forth,
Which troubles now the very lile of man

Το ihs inmosh depihs and all things overspreads
With doeth's derk pell, permiis no pleosure here*
To be pure end unolloyed. And ss to whei
Men soy es how diseeses ond disgraoe

Are more io feer ihen the abysms oi doeth,
How that they know the soul is mede oi blood,
Or wind perhaps, if so ii ohooses them,

And that they need 'noi our philosophy:

You may peroeive that oll these boasis ore made
For ostentation, not because ihey're true.

These very men exiled from their own lsnd,
Fer from the sight of men, live wretched lives,
Fouled by eho stein oi guilt, end sunk in core:
And yet where'er they eome, the soerifloei

They offer for the deod, end sley bleek sheep,
Propiiiete the infernal deiiies,

And when the days are'evil, turn themselves
with sermore nesi io whei religion says.

So you oen bether test e manin deys

Oi danger, end know what he really is

When adverse storms do blow: truih then ir forced

Maximus houd urget, leti timon*

i· Os. Sir Ι. Devles:

‘Who ever sees these irreligione men
with horden oi e elolrness wenk end leini,
But heere them talking oi religion then,
And vowlng oi their souls lro every esini·

'i'hls ls en illustreilon oi theold proverb, ‘The devll wss sloh, ihe

'signiri Daemon, monachus tuno esee volebat:
Dromon eonveluli: Daemon ui onie lulh'
