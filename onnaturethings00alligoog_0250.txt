To gaze on all things with a tranquil mind.

When wo look up to tho celestial vault,

To other flxed above with glittering stara,

When comes to mind tho course of sun and moon,

With wakonod force, the earo that it may bo,

This power of the Gods no limit has,

Which whirls tho bright stara in their various
