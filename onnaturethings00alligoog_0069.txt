”indemni L&mincis they fly to heaven and its flres,

,ἓξὲξ From air comes water, and from water earth;
„ffiffi Then all from earth in turn are reproduood,
Moisture, and air, and heat, that these again
Are ever changing, poss from heaven to earth,
And from the earth to the bright stare above.
But this the primel germs should never do:
Something unchanging sure must still bs left,
hest all to nothing ,should be quite reduced
For when things change end quit their proper
stete,
Theo that which wa·s, dies down and disappears;
So since these things which we heve named just
now
still change, 'tis clear that they must take their
form '
From that which cannot change, or else you have
All things return to nothing once again.
so why not rather hold that certain things
Ars so endowed by nature, that if they
Have flre produced, then ii a few you edd,
And soma remove, and change the order of
'l'hejr coming and their motion, you will find

Ν They all may interchange with one another.

Beneath the soaking rain that is outpoured;
Unless the sun ean do its pert, give heat
