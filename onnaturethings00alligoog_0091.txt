No, the whole storo oi matter through their frume
Muet be eought out, stirnod up through ull the
Thut ihmrhh’y obey tho motione oi the mind.

Oi these the heart ie fluet the origin:

y The uotion fluet commences with the will,

‘ And then tronemite itselr through every port
Quite different ie it when we move propelled
By blowe inflioted by onother'e strength
Againet our wishes, till the will hae reined
ltin So see you not that though ofttimee
Some outwenl loroe ean drive meu, eud eompel
Them onwerd 'geinet their will in heedlong

oourro,
Yet in our breoet there something still remeius
Which strugglee and resiste? A something whioh
When it thinks right, een change the stote of
And oen eontrol end oheek3 ond in ite oouree
The etore ol matter through the limbo ond frume
Is oft reined in, and settlee book again
And eo in germe we muet admit ae well
There ie another eouee of motion there,
'I'hon merely ‘blowe ond weighte: whenee we
derivo
Our power to eet: for nought from uought eun
oome.
For weight forbide thot ull things should hedone
By blowe of outeide fureo: yet leet the mind
Should feel within e stem neoeeeity
In ull it doee, ond like a conquered thing
Be ioreed to beer end suffer what it must,
From time to time, ut no flxed pleoe these eeode
Swerve from their ueuul course.
