Wee hard end oold a grin upon their mouth*

Grim all the while, their brow wee tense end
ewoll'n‚

And not long efter their still limbo were stretehed

In death. On the eighth day of the eun'e return,

At most upon the moth, their life was gone.

of whom if eny there avoided death,

For him, with ulcere foul ond bleok dieeherge,
There waited first decline, then death3

Or eleo with headeohe tointed blood would flow
From hie gorged nostrils: ond thus all his strength
And flesh too streamed away. And who escaped
This foul end aerid bloody dux, for him

Dieeaee aweited in hie frome end joines,

And sexuel ergene too: yet some there were
Dreeding the gete of death preferred to live
Deprived of these, end even lived without

Their hande or feet, some lost their eyes as well:
So strong the foer of death within their mind
And some oould not remember anything

Nor even knew themselves. And though they lay
Unburied on the ground, eorpee upon corpore,
The birds and wild beeets either kept ewey

'l'o avoid the horrid donch, or where perehanoe
They tested it, they met mist-following death.
Herdly et all did any bird appear,

'l'he cullen wild mesos never left the woode.
Many drooped with diseaee, end died et oneo.
Even the faithful dog† stretohed in tho street
