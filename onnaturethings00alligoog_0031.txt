INTRODUOTION

’Ξ ‘our sensas, and so give rise hy tho impact to the
} sensatione which we ieel on eye, or ear, or tongue,
,³ as the case may be. Thought is explained in a
like way, and so are dreams. The book concludes
with a disquisition on love, introduced by the
images oi the lovad one, so frequently occurring
to the lover’s mind. end the great dangers it in-
volves. And with a scathing satire on the lover’s
perils the book closes.

The fifth book shows how this infinite con-
·course oi atoms· described in the earlier part oi
the poem has in the end produced the world, and
life, and human society as we see it to-day. Itis
not, he affirms again, the work of gods-it has
been brought into existence by natural causes, by
the motions and contacte oi the atoma, the heavier
ones gradually sinking down to form the earth,
the lighter rising to produce the sun and moon
and stare. It has been termed the most mag-

nificent account of tha progross of the humen
rece that ever proceeded from mortal pen. Tha

main cause oi progress, as he indicates, hes been
the want men feel of this or that ior comfort
end convenience-the experiance which teeehes
them gradually to satisiy their wenis, and finally
the reason which co-ordinates the various expo·
rieures, and, as he says,

‘brings everything
To man's attention; reason raises them
Into the light oi day: for things must grow
One on another olearer and more bright
In erte until they’va reached their topmost

height*
