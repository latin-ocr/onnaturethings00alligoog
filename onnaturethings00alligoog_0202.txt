ΟΝ THE Neruas OF THINGS

Pliant and lovely Sicyonien shoes,
And set in gold green emeralds glow with light,
And see-green dresses still are worn away,
Drinking with constant use the swest of love.
'Phe weelth their fathers gained is turned aside
Το ribbons ior the bairand diadems:
Orto e robe, or dresses which they send
From Ceos or from Caria. With stuffs
Of wondrous beauty, and with viands rioh,
Feasts, gemes and drinking bouts, gerlande and
wreaths

And perfumes ars prepared3 in vain, in vain,
Since from the very heert oi these delights
A bitter something springs, something to sting'
Even smid the flowers, es when the mind
All conscientes-strichen feels a sad remorse
For wested years too often spent in sloth,
In brothels ruined, or because the fair
Has said some idle word, helf understood,
Which m the lovesiek heart burne Like a flre
Or else she caste her eyes too ireely round,
Smiles on another, or upon her feee
Is found the traces of e moeking smila·

And see you're not drawn rn. For to avoid

The being sutangled in the toils oi love

ls not so hard, as, when you‘rs taken ones,

'ro fly the snare, or to escape the mesh,

Whioh love has woven. Yet, though hindered so
And olose entengled you might yet ssoape,
