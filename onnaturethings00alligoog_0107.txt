Are from white seoda, aud black onae from the
Or those of any other shade you like
To take their ehade from secde of similar hua
The secde no colour have at all, unlike
Or like, yet if you fancy that the mind
Gan clothe them not with colour, you are wrong.
Why, men born blind, who've never seen the light,
Know bodies by the touch, and eo you know
That bodies colourlees from earliest days
Gan come within our keu, although they are
Of colour wholly void. So we ourselvee
See not the colour oi the things we touch
In darkness. Having proved this, Iproceed
'l'o show there are things, which from earliest days
Have had no oolour, and have eo remaiued
For colour may be changed to any other,
But primal germa change not: whate'er 'a to laet
N e’er suffere change, leet all things end in naught.
Whate’er by change deserte its settled bounda,
Death then ensues to that which wae before,
So do not dye the seoda with colour, leet
The whole return to nothingneee again.
