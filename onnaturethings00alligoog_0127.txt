'ris just es when sometimes the ioot is ill
'I'he head feels nothing. Thon again when we

Have given our limbs to gentle elumbers chains, .

And the tired body lies devoid of sense,

‘Pour’d out in loosneese on the gressy ground,'*

Something there is within, thet still con leel

J oyful emotions end the idle coros

Thot wring the heert. And now thet you moy

know

The soul is in the fremo, ond thet itis

No harmony thet makes us ell to feel,

Note this, thst when the body much hes lost,

Life olt remoins: while, on the other hond,

Remove some parts oi hect, expel the cir,

And llio ot once deserts the veios, and leaves

'l'he bones behind: from which you moy peroeive

All bodies ere not like in the part they play,

Nor equally contribule to our benith:

But thet those seeds, which bring us air end hest,

Bring life to us the most. There is then heot

And vitel uir within us, which bring death

When they deport to our deocying limbs.

Thon since we thus heve found the mind end soul

Are port of men, I prey you to give up

'l'his notion oi a harmony, o neme

Musicions brought from loity Helicon, ι

Or took from somewhere else, end so transferred

To whet required e neme. thte’er it be,

Why let them keep it, und attend to me.

Is head of oll, ond rules the whole. Q
