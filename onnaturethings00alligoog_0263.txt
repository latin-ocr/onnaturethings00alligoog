Unworthy thoughts of these high deities*
And alien to their peace, they often will

Thus slighted by you, do you some mischanoe;
Not that the high power of the Gods ean be
So outraged as in wrath to seek revenge,

But you will think yourself that they, although
They lead this quiet life, are rolling still

Great angry billowa and will not approach
With tranquil breast their shrines‚ nor able be
To have communion with those images

Which, from their sacred body make their way
Into the minds ol mon, to tell their power,
And so will miss the sweet tranquillity

Which such communion gives. Thus you may see
What life will follow. Be it far from us,

As 1 by reasoning show, and yet although

I've many things advanoed, much still remains
Το be adorned with polished verse. There is
The law of heaven and its torm to grasp,
Storms and bright lightnings to be sung, what thoy
Can do and whence are borne, lest hastily

In folly you divide the sky in parts,

Το see from which the volant flre has come,

Or whither gone, or how it made its way
Within our walls, and thence, the mastery won,
Esoaped again. Do thou, Calliope,

Deft muse, ot men the solaco, joy ol Gods,
Point out the roed before me as I run

'l'o the white limite of the final goel,

Thac, thee my laedor, I may win the prino.
