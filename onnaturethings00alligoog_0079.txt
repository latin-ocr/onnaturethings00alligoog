11116 the parts oi heaven below, no more than we
of our own will een fly 1ο heaven abovet

When they behold 1116 61111, we seo 1116 sbars,
They share with us 1116 sessons as they pass,
And have their nighis as long as are onr days

Β111 sure ’116 idle error has devised
Suoh dreams ior fools, because ihey have embraced
Falsa prinoiples. There ean no oenhre be
Where void and space ia infinite: nor if
There were a oanire, aould they 1661 them 111616,
Mors than they eould in any other plaoe.
For roorn end opaea, whieh we eall void, must 61111,
0611116 or no, give plaoe to ponderous weighie,
Wherever, in whatever wey bhey go:
Nor is 111616 any spob 61 whioh arrived
Bodies ean lose bheir force of gravity
And reeb on void: nor should 1116 void in burn
Suppori aughb, sinae by nature 11 gives way
Continually. Things therefore oannoi be
Togebher held by drawing te 1116 6611116.
Thines do Resides, 11 is not every‘ohing they think
111316ῗὲῗὲ gifrab ffiessesl 1ο abige oenbre, konly bhoshe ld
ea an we r,orsuo neers 6
Together by an earbhly body, as
The sea, 1116 mighiy mountain streame:
While 6111116 other hand they teaeh 111111 air
And lires wieh all their heat are borne away
And leave 1116 6611116, and 11161 66 11 is
Thai ether blekers with 1116 stare above,
Thai 1116 sun's flama is fed emidsb 1116 blue
Expanse of heaven, because 1116 11661 oolleols
In dying from 1116 oentre, nor oould trees
Ρ111 forth 111611 leaves upon 1116 topmosi boughs

Ii 11611116 did 1161 give 1116111 nourishment,
