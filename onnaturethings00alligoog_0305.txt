T. LUORE'I'IUS OARUS
vum-m.

Death had filled up with lifeless eumz

And all tho fanen where hoavenly sphitu dwoll.
stood full of corpses, for their koopors filled
'1'th all with guasto: religion then nor Gods
were munh aooounted of ε their present grief

Was all they thought of. All the bun'al fitne,

with which the euntem was to bo intomd,
Were intermitted: all was in dismay

And tmpidation: woh ono full of που

Buriod his own, in sorrow as he oould.

The across and taho ensuing povorty

Prompted to many deods of shamo, for then
Some placed their own relations on the pyrea
For others built, with loud uproer, themselves
Lighting tho torches, wrangling still with atrise
That often lod to blood, rather than leave
'Pho corpses that thoy lovod unhousollod thore.
