From their own body smell. As when you seek
To make sweet draught of myrrh and marjorsm
And flower of spikensrd emelling nectar-like,
You first must get, il possibly you een,
Some seentless oil, that gives no periume out,
'l'hat it ae little as is possible
Desii-oy by its own pungenoy the soenta
Mixed with it in the boiling. So the sestis
Which do beget things, must have neither emeli,
Nor sound, since nsught they ean emit themselves
Nor any teste, nor told, or hest at all.
For as they all, of whatsoever sort, must die
Whether they be oi body plisnt, soit,
Brittle and erumbling, porous or what not;
They all must be disjoined from the primsl eeeds
And separated quite, if ’tis our aim
To give to things foundations that will lest,
On whieh the universe may safely stand,
or'l'hat things may not return to nsught sgsin.
