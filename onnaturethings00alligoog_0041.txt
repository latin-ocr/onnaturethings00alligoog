And thy approach. the daedsl Esrth to thee
Offers sweet flowers‚ the plcins of Ocean smile‚
And heaven at peace with diffused splendour

shines.

For thee, when now the fece of spring is come,
And gentle breezes loosed have leave to blow,
The birds of sir cccleim thee on thy way,
Their hear-ts all smitten with the power of thee.
Then leep the wild herds in the pastures gay,
And brecst the swirling strenms: so by thy cherms
Enthrelled ecch follows wheresoe'er thou wilt.
Thus o’er the sees and hille end raging floods,
The leefy homes oi birds, the emereld plains,
In brsasts of cll implentiug fond desire,
Thy work it is each rece is still renewed,
. Esch following on according to his kind,

Since then through Nature thus thou rul’st alone
And without thee nsught sess the light oi day,

‘Then doe the selvcge besue begin to play
Their pleasant friskes, snd leeth their wonted leod:
The lyons rore3 the tygers loudly bray,
The raging bulls rebellow through the wood
And breaking forth dare tempt the despect flood,
'l'o come when thou deest drsw them wlth deshe:
So nll things else that nourish vltcll blood,
Soone ns wlth rury thou deest thern inspiro,

In gensrstlon sech to quench thelr inwnrd hro.

‘So cll the world by thee ut first was mede
And dsyly yet thou deest the same repsyre:
Ne ought ou enrth thet merry is sud glad,
Ne ought on earth thet lovely ls und hyre,
But thou the seme for pleasnrc dldst prepsyne:
Thou nrt the mot ol ull thet joyous is:
Grest god ot men oud women, queens ot th' syre,
Mother ot laughter end wel-spring ol blisse,
0 grant thet ol my love nt lust l may not misse:
