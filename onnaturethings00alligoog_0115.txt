Nor does death kill, and make an end of things,
But dieunitee their union, joins enew
In combinatione fresh, and so it is
Things change their shepes and colours and receive
Feelings, and in a moment yield them up:
So that from this you know, how much imperto
With whom, and in what way these sceda combine,
What motione they may give, and what receive:
N or must you think thet that which we can see
Fiitting upon the suriaco, now being born,
Now perishing again, can have their seat
Fixed deep within the world’s eternal germs.
Ev’n in this verse of oure, it matters much
What clemente it has, and how combined.
If all are not, the greater part you see

. Are quite unlike: it is the wey in which

'R 'l'hcy are disposed, that makes the difference.
*And so in matter's elements itis,
Their unione, motione, orders, figures change,
And when they do, the things themselves change
too.

fflgfib} And now, I pray, apply your mind to truth:

new ued. The question's new that seeks to gain your ears:
A new aspect of things declares itself,
Nought is eo easy as that it can be
Quite grasped at once, and n'aught so great and

strange

But that quite soon men cease to wonder at it
Look at the bright unsuliied sky above,
'Phe wandering constellatione that it holds,
'Phe moon, the eun’s too damling light, if these
Were all at once presented to man's gaze
Quibe unexpectedly, what could there be
More strange to be described, or more unlike
