Lm ΟΝ ΤΒΕ NATURE OF THINGS

And make them grew, fruita, trees, and living
things
Oen ne'er increase* Quite crue end eo with us, -
1f food and moieiure flne lend noi its eid,
'l'he body sure would perish, and ell liic
Oui of the bones end sinews peso away:
For we beyond a doubt ere nourishhd
And fed by cerhein things: others again
By othere in their turm In iroth it in
Because eo meny primel germe ere mixed
In many ways with various ohher things
Thet different things in various ways ere iod.
And often 'tie importent to observo
And note these primel germs, how they ere mixed,
And how ihey're placed, how they move to end
wh‘at motione they impert io each in turn,
For from the seme heaven, see, lende, rivers, eun,
Are formed, es well ae corn, trees, living things:
But they ere variously mixed io various ways.
Why everywhere, even in' this verse of oure,
'l'he letters oft ere ehared by many words
ln common, though you musi edmii the lines
And wolde still differ boch in sense ond seond,
So much cen be affected by e change
Of place: but those which are the primel germs
More things by combination cen produce.
