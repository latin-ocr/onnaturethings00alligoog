ΟΝ THE NATURE 01⁴* THINGS

wffits keen spur, and thrilled my broaet within

With the sweot Muee’e love. with this inspired

Βῑωιίρρωωι *fis eweot to approach
The untestod springs and drink‚ to oull fresh

flowere,
And gether for my browe e glorioue orown
With which the Muses in the days gone by
Have never deoked the browe of any man.
'Phio first beoeuea my theme ιε great, and 1
Efflot havw thoe mppsse minda from Qr
chahonds oehgtpus aoruples have imposed.
And next because 1 pon affinio lineii
On matters hard, and serioue, and attempt
To deok my poema with the Muee’s oharm.
'l'hat too would soem to me a usoful taak.
For aa physioians when they have to give

Some neuseous dreught to children, smear tho edge α

Arouhd the oup with the sweet yellow Juioe

of honey, that their uneuspeoting years

May thus bo dupod‚ as far aa lips ean be,

And ao may swallow down tho bitter draught
And though deooiveh* yet be not quite betrayed,
But by euoh moene reoruited strength regein. .
So I now sinoe thie teaohing aeeme to bo

Bitter to those who have not handled it,

And tho common herd ata1t back on eeeing it,

. I have resolved to explain our plan to you

In eweat Pien'an verso, and emear it o'er
With the sweet honoy of the Muees’ song,
1f so by those meane I might fix your mind

' numo quotes Beirtex's hanalatlon ot Tmo:
‘'l'hoy drlnk‘ dooeived, and eo decalvet! they Ilva'
