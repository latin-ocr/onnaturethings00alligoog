Since then the woter, when the bowls ere broken,
Yon see flow forth, deperting every way,
And mist ond smolre dissolvo themselves in 111,
Yon must believe the soul too is dissolved,
And mueh more quiokly dies and posses off
Into its primal etoms, when it once
Hos left the body: thet, os you may soy,
Is the soul’s bowl‚* 1111 when it oonnot hold
It longor, shettered by some fleroe 1111111,
Or by the look of blood within tho veins,
How oon it be together held by oir,
Tho 111 whioh is 111· lighter then our frome
· And more inoompetent to hold it in?†
131⁶„thss Besides we seo the 11111111 surely born

ἦ· Together with the body: grows with it:

''ffl'And with it too grows 111111 for even 11
Children with body troil ond delioote
Tottor about, their mind es feeble too:
Yet when they’ve reached maturity of years,
Their judgmont’s stronger, end their mind more

firm:

Thon after, when tho mighty force of years
Their frome hos shaken, ond their limbs collapso
With bluntod strength, the intelleot grows dim,
The tonguo tolks nonsonse ond tho mind givos wey,
And 111 things fail, 1111 all together go.§
