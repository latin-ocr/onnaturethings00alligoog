Yet there ere obhere3 we heve lived before

without her. And we know full well she does

'l'he eelfeeme things on ugly women does,

Drenohee hemelf with eoente, poor thing. until

Her meida fly from her with e emethered laugh‚

And yet tho weeping lover, when shut out,

Ost leode her threshold with hie flowere ond

Anointe her doore eo proud with marjorem,

And planta hie kieeee on the steps themselves.

And yet, 11 onee admitted, but a breath

Offends his sense, he eeeke at oneo to find

Some epeoioue protext to deport end go,

Let’s fell the deep complaints he’e oonned eo long,

Oureee hie folly, eeee he’s given to her

More than ie right to mortale to eonoede.

Our Venueee know this: ond they themselves

With all their might conceal whet’e going on

Behind the soenes, from those they wish to hold
