stau move and change position, though they are
of solide formed. The reasoning is false. Ι
For how unless the waters made a way

Oould flshes onwerd swim? How could the waves
· Give place, or whither go, ii they shall not

Be ableto go forwerd? So either then

Some bodies are of motion still deprived

Or else there ie a void, where each thing takes

The first idea oi movement. So again

Ii when they meet, two bodies quickly part,

Surely it must be air, thet occupics

Tho void that comes betweenz and yet though

quick ’

Its currente ilow to ocoupy the space,

It cannot all at once be filled: it fille

Eech part in turn, until the whole be full.

But if one thinks, when bodies separate

''lis thet the air condensos, heis wrong: ·

For then there is a void which was not there ’

Before, while that which was, is filled again.

Nor cen the cir condense in such a way,

Nor if indeed it could, without a void

Oould it, methinks, contract itsolf and draw

Its parts together into one again.
