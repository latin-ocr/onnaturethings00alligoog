From the other eoast: herois Charybdis vast.

While Eltna rumbling threatens ones again

Το gether up the iury of its flames,

And beleh forth from its throat its fires, and dash

Right up to heaven the flashing oi its flama.

Now while this land is worthy to be seen,

And should be visited, so rioh in wealth,

So strong in men to guard it, nothing seems

Το be more famous, more to be revered,

More deor, more wondrous than this man himself.

The etrains of his great genius ery eloud‚

His great discoveriee proolaim to all,

That ev'n he soaree appears of mortal birth.
affl Yet even he end those whom we have named,

Inferior to him, and muoh leesor men,

Although they’ve given from their heart of hearts

Many divine diseoveries, and muoh

That’e truly great in a moro serious way,

And based on iar more true and certain grounds

Thon Pythia, who speaks with laurei orowned

From Phoebus' temple, yet have shipwreek made

As to the way things first began: and though

So great themselves, great was the fall they made.

First 'tis because rejecting void in things

They yet assign them motione, and deelaro

Sueh things ae air, lire, earth, and sun, and eorn,

And living things to be oi texture slight,

And yet without a void: and secondly

Because they put no limit to the way

ln whieh you can divide them, and no stay

Το breaking them, and think there is in things

No smallest part, although we see that that

Is still the bounding point, whioh to our sense

Appears the least: from this you ean infer,
