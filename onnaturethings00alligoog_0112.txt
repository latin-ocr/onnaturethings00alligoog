st Μ ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ΝΔΤΠΒΕ OF TfflNas

To flesh and nervas and veins, which still we see
Ars soit, of mortal body. Yet even ii

We think that these romain eternally,

Either they have the sense attaching to

Some part, or else they must be deemsd to have

The sense belonging to all living things.

But surely not alone the parts have sense:

Each looks to something elsa: the hand alone

Parted from us no feeling has: nor can

The other parts ieel oi themselves: and so

They're like to other living things, they feel

As we, that they may work in concert still

With tho vital sense. How then can it be said

That they’re the germs oi things, and shun ths

paths

of death, since after all they are but living things,

And living things are mortal, all of them?

Nay, could they do it, by their union ,

And close companionship they would effect

Naught but a jumbled crowd of living things:

Just as you know men, herds, and savage beasts

Can naught beget hy union. li they should

Their own sense lay asido, another’s take,

What use in having it? Besides thore is

The point we urged, that chieks irem eggs appear,

And worm's burst f01tl1 when with torrential rains

The earth has rotted, all these go to prove

Feeling can come from that which does not fssl.
Μωῦῧῡξ But if one say that feeling comas from that

ffizmtg} Which hae none, by a sort oi change, or else

omnm: Because itis begotten by a kind

Oi birth, enough to show and make it plain

Tharais no bi1th without an union first,

No change until the germs have met together.
