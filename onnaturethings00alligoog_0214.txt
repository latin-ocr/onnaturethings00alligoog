By lend and eea? why do the eeeeons bring
Diseeee? why scalke ebroad untimely death?
The beby, too, just like a seilor weced
By cruel weveu lies naked on the ground,
Poor child. bereit oi every meane of life,
Ae econ ee it hus left iis mother’s womb
In hhroee of birth, und fflls hhe room with squelle,*
Ae ie but meet ior one who has to pnes
Such ille in life. But flocke end herde end heusis,
All grow oi various kinds, no rutiles want,
No bland ond broken voice of gentle nureo
Need be uddressed to them, nor do thoy need
Their clothing ohenging with the time of year:
They need no arms, no loity wells lo guard
'l'heir own, since earth iteeli end nature, loo,
Skilful artificem, produce them ull.
’thld And first oi all since the muse of earth idacii,

ν fflss'l And water, end the light brooch oi the nir,
And burning hoece, of which the universe
seems frumed, do ell consish of substance, which
Wes born end diee again, il follows chet
The universe is subiectio like lew.
'lhose things whose parts end membere hed e birth
And yet ere montel, those we see must die, '
Ae they were born. Since then I thus cen ree
The chiofeet perne end membere oi the world
Die down end are renewed, I mey be sure
For heaven end earth es well there’e been e time
When they began, a time when they will die.
