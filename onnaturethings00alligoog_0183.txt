The meaning ol the words: eo quite oonfunod

And hindemd ie the voice that eomes to you.

Δ single wonl oft reeehee to the een

Fliee into many words at oneo, whioh reeeh

The eeverel ears, each word distinet and clear.

Such voices, ee don’t fell upon the ears,

Are emied pest end loet in idle air.

But some that atrike upon eome eolicl thing

Are thence thrown bech, end in the eound they

They mook you with en eoho of the word.

When thie you μειερ, you ean explain with eene

To othere and yemali, how oft the mohs

In lonely epole give beck the words again,

When etreylng friends we eeek on darheome hille,

And summon with a ehouh Myeelf have seen

Spole that returned even voieee eix or seven,

Though onee you epoke-thue hille on hille

Reverberete the werde which lend themselves

Ol faune whose nightly revela and glad oporte

Bmek, they allego, the eilenee ol the hille,

Musio aweke, end the eweet melodiee

The pipo poure forth responsive to the skill
