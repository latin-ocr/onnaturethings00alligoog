And all things else, does netum st s werd
create and lay before us? Aye, sv'n when

To others in the very sslf-sams spot

Their mind is thinking of quite different things·
what shall we say, when lmages we sse
Preesed in rhythmle order in οιιι· dream,

And move their plienl limbs, while ell the while
One arm upon another stin they reiss

In nimble leshion, end in eum· present

Before our eyes esch gesture in its tum

with foot that moves in eune. Yes, imegss
Are full ol erl, end vender still prepared

By night to fumlsh us with spos-ts like thess.
Oris this rather erue, that ln one time

which we ere eonseious of, when but one word
Is spoken, many times lie hid

Thac resson esu dlseem, end so ie is

At any one, in any plane you like

These imegss ers ready to appear?

And yse boemus they sm se thiu, the mind.
without an effere, cannot see them there,

And all seve those it lm taken lo itsslf

Must pess away. Se it properes iessll,

And hopes to see the things that ere to nomez
And so they come. De you not sss the eyes,
When they begin te look elz tlny things,
Propere end strain themselves, οι· otherwise
We could net see distinetlyl Thus you *mey

¹In things thee ers quite plain, soon reeognlss,
If you don’l keep your mind upon the elmenh,
Tis just es if the thing were fer semovsd

In time and pleae. what wonder is it then

If ell eseepss the mind, seve these en whieh
Its whole attentione flxstl me little elungs
