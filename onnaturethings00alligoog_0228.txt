ΟΝ THE NATURE OF Tmolos

mm.
Merked by no redienee, whieh een yet inoreeee
All full of heeh the volume oi hie reys.
“⁸ Μ Νοι· ie ib eleorly stated how the eun
Posses from summer querier end drawe neor
Hie winter turning-point in Geprieorn,
And ihenoe rehurning iekee himself again
To the eolehiiiel goel of Oaneer3 nor
How in e mouth the moon een trevel o'er
The epeoe it takes the eun e year ho go.
No oleer end ehhple reeeon ie alleged:
lt well may be,·'he the opinion
of that good men Democritus leid down,
The neerer that the stare ere to hhe earth,
The lese on them the soree whioh heaven'e whirl
Exores. Iis repid force, he eeys, gete lese
When neerer earth, ite power diminiehes‚
And so hhe eun is left with the reerwerd signs,
Being lower then the signs, whioh burn eo bright.

And yet fer more the moon: the foriher that
Her oouree from heaven is, the neerer eerhh,
The lese oen ehe keep paee with the other signe.
For ee more ieeble grows the whirl‚ in whioh

She still ie borne, though lower then the eun,
So muoh hhe other signs oen paee her by.

And therefore 'hie her oourse eppeere oo oome
More quiekly beok to them: they eome oo her. ii
Ii mey be too, from quartem oi the world

Lying eorose his poth, the eir may stream

At different seoeone in alternate ways,

One which een pueh the eun from summer riguo

'ro his winter turning-poini, end ohilly eold,

And one which brings him beck from the oold
shades

To summer quarters end the blezing signe.
