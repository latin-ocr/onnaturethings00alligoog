mmm with strong reserves and haavy horae,

Sea them full armed all eager lor tho fight,
'Mid these things, if religione semplee fly

In hemer from your mind, and feare of death
Tben leave your braant ab ease ιιιι free from ιιιιι “
When thet your fleat ιοιιιιιιιιι lhe eeae afar:
Yet if we ιιι that lheee things after all
Are monheriee, ιιι foed for laughher still,
And if the feare of men, their haunting nares,
my not hhe ιοιιιιι of war nor elaeh of arms,
But holdly seiza on kinge and petenham?
Respeea not flaehing gold nor puxple robae,
In splendour bright, how ean you ever doubt
The power of mighty ιιιιοιι, all ιιι more
Sinee life is but a struggle in ιιι dark?
fflor juel ιι children tremble in the nighh,
And faar whatever ιιιιιιι, ιο ιιι at timae
Ιιι daylighh dread things no more to be feared
Than thoee which frighl the children, whieh they
ιιι eure to come. This terror surely then,
Thia darkness of the mind, ’tie not the ιιιιί
Bright raye, nor glithering ehalls of light expel
But Natnre'e fane and knowledge of her lawe.

Mon οἰ See now I will explain what motion ’lis

And, when begotten‚ break lehem up again,
