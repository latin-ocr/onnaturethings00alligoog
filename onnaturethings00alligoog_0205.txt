Post bound in ohoins of lovo; in vain, sinoo you

In thought oon drow forth oll those things she
‹ does

Into tho light of day, ond noto hor smiles,

And if sho is but fair ond troo from spito,

Gan overlook in turn tho faults she hoo,

And pordon frooly human woaknessos.

[Lines 1192-1278 omittet]

„offluffl Sometimes not by tho Gods, or Venus* shifts
'¹¹¹ ¹⁰V⁶· A sorry woman not so fair is lovod.

Such women sometimes by tho things they do,
By their engaging monuero, by the coro
With whioh thoy dress, aooustom you to poss
Your life with them. And habit too sometimes
Gan render love attractiv05 what is struck
By oftropootod blows however light,
In tho long run is mosterod ond givos way.
Do you not seo how drops of wotor fall
On rookS, and after long years wear thom through?
