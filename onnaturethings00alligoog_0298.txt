From home and country far aro often tried

By the strangenoss of cho elimato and tho rainu
So different bo their own? Just think how much
Doos Britain’s* elimato differ, irom that which
We flnd in Egypt where the world’s axis

Halts in its course? Or yet in Pontus land,
And Oadiz, and where moos of mankind

Live burnod blank by sun? J usi as we soe

Four different elimatos lying thus benonin

Four different winda and 'quartem of tho sky,

So the complexion and the iace oi mon
