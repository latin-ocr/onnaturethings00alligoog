A void is formed, whether ethwert or from
Above, the neighbouring bodies straight are borno
Into tho void: they are disturbed by blows
From other sources, nor oi their own will

For air surrounding still beets on the things

Sometimes it happens 'thet the iren reosdes
When it meets the stone, end ev’n is went to dy
And iollow in its turn. For Ι heve seen
Some iron ringo in Samothreoe jump up,
