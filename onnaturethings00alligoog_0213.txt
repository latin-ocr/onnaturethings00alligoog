And keep it everlastingly renewetl

fflffi} Yet this I’d venture 16 affirm, from what

oyoosa I see of heaven, and many things beside
Point 116 same way, that 661 ior us was made
By Gods 116 nature of 116 things we see:
So many 166116 there are. In 116 first plaoe
Of all 116 space vast heaven reaohes o’er,
A part is 16166 up by savege hille
And woods 61 wild 166616 1611; ’116 held by rooks,
Waste marshes, and 116 severing main which
pares*
'Phe different lands, over two-thinis of 11 ’
Fieroe burning 1661 end 66661661 oold bear away,
And take away 116 6661616666 from men.
What's 1611 ior iillage nature by 116611
Would oholre with thoros, 11 man’s own power

1166161, aooustomod 66 16 16 16 groan .
Beneaih 116 hoavy hoe, and oleove 116 earth
By pressing down 116 plough. If we did 661
By turning up 116 11611161 alode with share, ·
And working up 116 6611, bid orops to riso,
They oould 66161 themselves avail 16 spring
Into 116 liquid ains and even 1166
Orops won by heavy 1611, when they put forth
'l'heir leaves and blossoms over all the land,
The sun above with buming 1661 destroys,
Or sudden showers and ioy 16616 lay low,
And 116616 61 61666 with furious whirlwinds vex.
And why does nature nourish and bring forth
Dread herde of wild 166616, dangerous 16 man
